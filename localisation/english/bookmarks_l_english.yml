Whole economies and countries were destroyed during this war with many not fully recovering even to this day. The United States turned into a consitutional monarchy, the Russians became a Socialist Tsardom, and the Bonapartes were restored to the French throne. All the meanwhile the German Empire has contiuned its hegemony, the only question is for how much longer?"
 SOV_DESC:0 "After the second civil Russian war, True Russia took victory leading to a hybrid Russian monarchy and soviet system merging to create the Union of Mladorossi restoring the Empires glory placing Russia on the world stage ready to dominate over eastern Europe. By 1992 times were very different, instability in the union had increased leading to Gorbachev creating the Belovezha Compromise leading to 3 core parts of Russia (Great Russia, Lesser Russia(Ukraine) and White Russia) have equal representation in Congress. Even after this compromise the union still could not be saved, The Great Cocand Uprising of 1998, Chechen war of 2002-2005 left scars in Asia and the Caucasus with tensions growing. Now Russia lays in turbulent times as the reforms from Gorbachev failed leading to wealthy oligarchs taking over and more western influence spreading into Russia, plans were made to fix the union but with the 2008 financial crisis this was the final nail in the coffin."
 WAL_DESC:0 "The isolated state of Wales ruled by the national populist leader Gethin Gruffydd believes in Celtic supremacy and Wales can become great on its own with his own vison when in reality the economy is worthless, it relies heavily on Ireland and Scotland with much of the world not recognising the state as well as constant threats coming from the U.S.B.R. Many believe that England shall soon take back Wales unless the small state can somehow defend itself and the mighty dragon can roar on its own."

 ENG_DESC:0 "The United Socialist British Republic was ruled by Michael foot until his sudden death which then lead to Anthony Charles Lynton Blair become leader. Blair pushed a huge new military dicatorship over the state threatening to take back the states of Scotland and Wales as well as imposing harsh laws over the population. The year is 2010 and now as Blairs rule becomes unstable many believe it will only take some time before he falls and a new member of his party takes over and changes the history of the republic unless he is able to overcome others in the party and secure the British Isle."
  SCO_DESC:0 "After the Second Weltkrieg Germany helped Scotland move to an independent nation as well as Germany helping Scotland during the Dumfries War.Germany installed Francis onto the throne, who created an alliance between Germany and Scotland inviting the young nation into the Reichspakt. Francis rebuilt Scotland into a thriving nation where its people lived freely under a constitutional monarchy in which democracy glows bright. Francis is looked upon as a peoples leader who is loved by the Scottish people and always stands against the English by ensuring the English refugees who flee from the USBR are welcome and have a home in Scotland."
  USA_DESC:0 "The Greater Empire of America was birthed from the ashes of the old United States of America following the end of the Second American civil war. The Norton's have become one of the most recognizable royal families in history and have been able to provide stability to the once fractured country, but it has once again become divded after the controversial 2008 election where Bernard 'Bernie' Sanders won in a narrow victory. Some hail him as the savior of the country while others plaster him as a puppet of the Russians. At this point, who knows what will happen?"

  GER_DESC:0 "Germania, from the end of the First Weltkrieg has suffered near tragedy after near tragedy. Suffering through a political crisis and a defeat on the Eastern front, The Second Reich was only saved by the combined efforts of their own forces alongside the ententes.After a long period of reconstruction, the Empire would once again face a crisis, one which lasted decades. Syndicalism, thought to be extinguished would rear its head once again in a period known as “the troubles”. From 1960-1999 the German people lived in fear of terror attacks and open rebellions, but that all came to an end with the arrest of Angela Merkle aka “The Red Death”.As the Empire prepares to restore civilian rule, many wonder what new challenges it may face, and if the Second Reich can truly last another hundred years let alone another decade."
