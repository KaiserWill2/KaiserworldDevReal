 ###EVENTS###
 annex.1.t:0 "$AFG_conquer$"
 annex.1.d:0 "After a hard-fought campaign across the mountains, Kabul has finally fallen! Even so, the local populace has not taken our conquest lying down, and we are left with an untenable situation. Do we relent and allow the Afghanis to form their own state under our guidance, or do we continue our occupation despite the cost?"
 annex.1.o1:0 "Let them govern themselves."
 annex.1.o2:0 "This land is ours now!"
 annex.2.t:0 "$ALA_conquer$"
 annex.2.d:0 "Alaska, the Last Frontier, is now in our hands! Our garrisons are watching over the population centers, but the vast area makes it difficult to effectively project our power. Maybe it would be better to give them some measure of self-government?"
 annex.2.o1:0 "Yes, that sounds like a good idea."
 annex.2.o2:0 "Our American allies should take it back."
 annex.2.o3:0 "No, this is ours now!"
 annex.3.t:0 "$ALB_conquer$"
 annex.3.d:0 "Our Balkan campaign has borne fruit, as Albania is now under our control. However, the population is still opposed to our occupation, and our garrisons are having issues keeping them in line. Maybe an Albanian client state would keep tensions cool?"
 annex.3.o1:0 "Best to keep the Balkans content."
 annex.3.o2:0 "We will keep the occupation."
 annex.5.t:0 "$ALG_conquer$"
 annex.5.d:0 "After our campaign in the Sahara, Algiers has been successfully captured by our military. However, a guerrilla campaign has begun across the territory by local forces, and it seems likely we'll see further casualties as the occupation continues. Perhaps an Algerian-led government would soothe tensions?"
 annex.5.o1:0 "Let the Algerians govern themselves, under our watchful eye."
 annex.5.o2:0 "How much harm could Algerians cause anyway?"
 annex.6.t:0 "$AMA_conquer$"
 annex.6.d:0 "Amalfi, the former capital of the Duchy of Amalfi, has been separated from Italy once and for all by our design. However, this wealthy city-state may be better off under our control. After all, a port in Southern Italy would be invaluable to our navy. What should we do?"
 annex.6.o1:0 "We promised an independent city-state, and they will get one."
 annex.6.o2:0 "This port is too valuable to give up!"
 annex.7.t:0 "$ANG_conquer$"
 annex.7.d:0 "Luanda has finally been more or less pacified by our troops, but greater problems are already happening for our garrisoned forces. The local population, already veterans of guerrilla warfare, have been causing non-stop issues for us, and it is difficult to justify continuing the occupation. A few local leaders sympathetic to our cause have suggested creating a client state to provide a level of self-governance. Should we listen?"
 annex.7.o1:0 "They can govern themselves."
 annex.7.o2:0 "They know nothing."
 annex.8.t:0 "$ANT_conquer$"
 annex.8.d:0 "The islands of Antigua and Barbuda have been successfully pacified by our troops. Still, the local population is uneasy at losing their sovereignty, and some locals have petitioned us to give them some level of self-government."
 annex.8.o1:0 "Occupying them is a waste of resources."
 annex.8.o2:0 "The island ports are too valuable to risk."
 annex.9.t:0 "$ARG_conquer$"
 annex.9.d:0 "Our campaign across La Plata has succeeded, and Buenos Aires is securely under our control. However, our occupation force is unpopular among the local population, and attacks against our troops are common in the outskirts of the country. Some local figures among their population have suggested we make a nominally independent Argentinian government to keep the peace. Maybe they have a point?"
 annex.9.o1:0 "Yes, it's better to let them govern themselves."
 annex.9.o2:0 "These lands are too valuable to just give up."
 annex.10.t:0 "$ARI_conquer$"
 annex.10.d:0 "The Arizonan military was no match for us, and Phoenix is now under our control. Still, it is difficult to effectively occupy this barren desert, so perhaps it would be easier to set up a client state to govern?"
 annex.10.o1:0 "No harm in letting them govern."
 annex.10.o2:0 "Our American allies can deal with them."
 annex.10.o3:0 "It's a barren desert, but it's OUR barren desert."
 annex.11.t:0 "$ARM_conquer$"
 annex.11.d:0 "With the Soviet government gone, the former Armenian SSR is tenuously under our control. Even so, Armenian independence groups have flourished since the beginning of our occupation, and some local leaders have petitioned us for an Armenian state independent of foreign control. Obviously we would never give them full independence, but maybe a client state ruling in our name would be easier than full occupation?"
 annex.11.o1:0 "The Armenians can have their state, as long as they play nice."
 annex.11.o2:0 "Moscow will love to have them back."
 annex.11.o3:0 "These mountains are ours."
 annex.12.t:0 "$ASS_conquer$"
 annex.12.d:0 "With Indian lands conquered, we must now consider how to deal with the states of the subcontinent on an individual basis. The question on the table now is Assam, a region in the Northeast that a long and storied history, even before joining India. Occupying the area would be a nightmare, but some locals are interested in forming a client state to rule in our name. Should we take them up on their offer?"
 annex.12.o1:0 "Yes, let their history continue."
 annex.12.o2:0 "Our Indian ally can take them back."
 annex.12.o3:0 "Our Muslim brothers will handle them."
 annex.12.o4:0 "Their new chapter in history will be under our boots."
 annex.13.t:0 "$AST_conquer$"
 annex.13.d:0 "Our campaign across the Outback is finally complete, and Australia is under our control. Even so, the question still remains of what to do with this new land. We could create a united Australian client state, but we could also break it up into its constituent states to prevent a unified resistance. We could also continue the occupation, but this wil not go over well with the population."
 annex.13.o1:0 "Australia will be liberated."
 annex.13.o2:0 "Australia will be separated."
 annex.13.o3:0 "Australia will be occupied."
 annex.14.t:0 "$AUS_conquer$"
 annex.14.d:0 "Austria has been separated from Germany once again, and her future is now in our hands. Some friends of our administration have suggested an Austrian client state will be the best way to protect our interests in the newly reborn nation. Of course, we could always continue the occupation, regardless of public opinion."
 annex.14.o1:0 "We will support the Austrian people!"
 annex.14.o2:0 "Actually, Germany should keep them. It's better this way."
 annex.14.o3:0 "Occupation is nothing new to them anyway."
 annex.15.t:0 "$AZR_conquer$"
 annex.15.d:0 "With the Soviet government in Azerbaijan gone, the people of Azerbaijan are rejoicing, but their fate is still up in the air. For the moment, our troops are still occupying the area, but this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. What should we do with this newly freed land?"
 annex.15.o1:0 "Give them a state of their own to govern."
 annex.15.o2:0 "Actually, the Moscow government will treat them well."
 annex.15.o3:0 "The Azeris are unready for a state."
 annex.16.t:0 "$BHM_conquer$"
 annex.16.d:0 "With our Caribbean campaign ending, we have secured our control over the islands of the Bahamas. The occupied population is still uneasy with our occupying force, however, and we should consider setting up a client state to rule in our name."
 annex.16.o1:0 "Sure, why not?"
 annex.16.o2:0 "Those ports are too important."
 annex.17.t:0 "$BAH_conquer$"
 annex.17.d:0 "With Iran cowed, we are looking into the situation of Bahrain. The small island in the Arabian Sea is wary of our occupation, and if we are to make a decision about the future of Bahrain we should do so now."
 annex.17.o1:0 "A Bahrainian client state will be of use to us."
 annex.17.o2:0 "Give it back to Iran. They'll appreciate it."
 annex.17.o3:0 "We'll keep it. Those ports are valuable to us."
 annex.18.t:0 "$BAL_conquer$"
 annex.18.d:0 "Baloch nationalists have been active for decades, and now that their lands are under our control, they are asking for a state of their own to govern. We owe them nothing, but if we give them nothing they may turn their guns against our occupation forces. How should we proceed?"
 annex.18.o1:0 "Balochistan shall be free!"
 annex.18.o2:0 "Give the land to our allies. They know how to handle it."
 annex.18.o3:0 "We will administer the land directly."
 annex.19.t:0 "$BNG_conquer$"
 annex.19.d:0 "Dhaka has become a hotbed of insurgency since our conquest of Bangladesh, and we should consider how we should proceed. We have the opportunity to gether some local leaders to form a client state to rule on our behalf, but ultimately the choice is ours."
 annex.19.o1:0 "A client state would be best."
 annex.19.o2:0 "India knows how to handle them."
 annex.19.o3:0 "Surely Pakistan will treat them with respect this time..."
 annex.19.o4:0 "Unite them with Bengal. It'll make the borders clean at least."
 annex.19.o5:0 "We will take it for ourselves."
 annex.20.t:0 "$BRB_conquer$"
 annex.20.d:0 "The Caribbean campaign has brought the island nation of Barbados under our control. Proposals for a client state have been presented by some local leaders, but continuing the occupation is not out of the question..."
 annex.20.o1:0 "The occupation isn't worth it."
 annex.20.o2:0 "Those ports are worth it."
 annex.21.t:0 "$BSQ_conquer$"
 annex.21.d:0 "The former region of Spain known as the Basque Country has fallen to our troops, but our occupation forces have had a mixed reception from the people. We have been praised by some Basque leaders for liberating them from Spain, but at the same time they fear they have traded one occupier for another. What are we to do?"
 annex.21.o1:0 "The Basque people shall have their country."
 annex.21.o2:0 "Surely Spanish rule wasn't that bad..."
 annex.21.o3:0 "Their land is too valuable to just give up."
 annex.22.t:0 "$BAV_conquer$"
 annex.22.d:0 "For the first time in 150 years, Germany has been divided between North and South. Our advisors have proposed that Austria, along with the German states of Bavaria, Franconia, and Baden-Württemberg, be consolidated into a renewed South German Confederation. Hopefully, these advisors note, this division of land will finally cow the Germans into submission and prevent them from causing more threats to world peace."
 annex.22.o1:0 "A South German Confederation it shall be."
 annex.22.o2:0 "Actually, its better to keep a strong Germany in our sphere."
 annex.22.o3:0 "These Germans cannot be trusted with a state of their own."
 annex.23.t:0 "$BLR_conquer$"
 annex.23.d:0 "After a long campaign through former Soviet lands, Minsk is now thoroughly occupied by our forces. Even so, the future of Belarus is still an open question. We could continue our occupation, in spite of the mounting protests by the population, but we could also make a client state to help the protests simmer down."
 annex.23.o1:0 "A client state is a fine solution."
 annex.23.o2:0 "Give them back to Moscow."
 annex.23.o3:0 "We're not afraid of a few protestors."
 annex.24.t:0 "$BEL_conquer$"
 annex.24.d:0 "Our invasion was costly, but Belgium is nonetheless under our control. Our troops now patrol the streets of Brussels as the population awaits their uncertain future. How should we proceed?"
 annex.24.o1:0 "We will make a client state for them."
 annex.24.o2:0 "We will continue our occupation."
 annex.25.t:0 "$BLZ_conquer$"
 annex.25.d:0 "The small Central American nation of Belize was easy to conquer, but occupying the land is proving more of a challenge. The population is furious at our occupying force, and we should consider making a client state with what collaborators we can find."
 annex.25.o1:0 "A client state will ensure stability."
 annex.25.o2:0 "Our Central American allies will integrate them."
 annex.25.o3:0 "Our occupation is for the best."
 annex.26.t:0 "$BEN_conquer$"
 annex.26.d:0 "With Porto Novo now pacified by our occupation forces, Benin is under our control. However, the population is not likely to take this new state of affairs lightly, so considerations have been made to create a client state."
 annex.26.o1:0 "Yes, a client state is in our interests."
 annex.26.o2:0 "Benin belongs to us now."
 annex.27.t:0 "$BHU_conquer$"
 annex.27.d:0 "The isolated mountain nation of Bhutan is now occupied by our forces, and we must now consider our options for these lands moving forward. We could consider continuing our annexation outright, but we could also find some local collaborators to form a client state."
 annex.27.o1:0 "form a client state."
 annex.27.o2:0 "We shall occupy Bhutan."
 annex.28.t:0 "$BIH_conquer$"
 annex.28.d:0 "With Indian lands conquered, we must now consider how to deal with the states of the subcontinent on an individual basis. The question on the table now is Bihar, the birthplace of the Maurya and Gupta Empires. Annexing this state outright would be a colossal effort, but some potential collaborators have been found that could lead a client state to rule in our name."
 annex.28.o1:0 "Give them a client state."
 annex.28.o2:0 "Give the land to our Indian friends."
 annex.28.o3:0 "We will not risk another empire forming. Occupy them!"
 annex.29.t:0 "$BOL_conquer$"
 annex.29.d:0 "The South American country of Bolivia has been defeated, but now we must consider our policy with these lands moving forward. A direct occupation may be costly, but there is always the possibility of finding collaborators to rule in our name."
 annex.29.o1:0 "A client state will ensure stability."
 annex.29.o2:0 "Those resources belong to us!"
 annex.30.t:0 "$BOS_conquer$"
 annex.30.d:0 "One of the many nations within Yugoslavia, Bosnia is now under our control. However, the costs of the occupation are beginning to rise and now there is the question of how to handle these new lands."

 annex.290.o1:0 "The Southerners shall make Virginia whole again."
 annex.290.o2:0 "This land is best left to the Northerners."
 annex.290.o3:0 "This land is best left to the Northerners."
 annex.290.o4:0 "Give the land back to our American allies."
 annex.290.o5:0 "This strip of land is better off with us."
 annex.291.t:0 "The Conquest of New England"
 annex.291.d:0 "After our campaign across the northeast, New England has come under our control. Though once held by the American People's Commonwealth, New England still maintains a strong regional identity of its own. Military occupation is still an option, but we also have the choice to build a loyal client state out of the region."
 annex.291.o1:0 "Establish a client state."
 annex.291.o2:0 "Give the land to our American allies."
 annex.291.o3:0 "Surely occupying Boston has never gone wrong before..."
 annex.292.t:0 "A New American Leader"
 annex.292.d:0 "With the American People's Commonwealth reinstated, we are now in a position to support one of the many factions who opposed the pacifism of Chomsky's Old Guard. The Central Committee is the most obvious choice, having pushed for a strong socialist state for decades and containing many 'amenable' candidates for the vacant Presidency. We could also hand power over to the Trade Councils, advocates of syndicalist thought and the keys to the industrial heartland of the Steel Belt. In addition, an interesting offer has come to us from one Bill Gates, head of the Technology Council, offering his unwavering loyalty in exchange for the Presidency. There are many options, but we must pick one."
 annex.292.o1:0 "Pick a new President from the ranks of the New Guard."
 annex.292.o2:0 "The Central Committee can rule without a President."
 annex.292.o3:0 "The Trade Councils are best suited for the task."
 annex.292.o4:0 "Bill Gates shall have our support."
 annex.293.t:0 "A New American Leader"
 annex.293.d:0 "With the UAPR reinstated, we are now in a position to support one of the three unofficial 'factions' of the Politburo. The Centralists, most associated with Angela Davis, are seen by many as the natural choice, having been the ruling faction of the UAPR for decades. There is also the Liberationist faction, most associated with Jarvis Tyner, with a doctrine of rapid reunification that may be beneficial to our long-term goals, though some also see them as revisionists. Finally, there is the Unionist faction, represented by John Foster, who are the most orthodox and internationalist Communist faction, but his hardline anti-Americanist stance may cause significant resistance in the future. Which faction shall we empower?"
 annex.293.o1:0 "The Centralists are the obvious choice."
 annex.293.o2:0 "The Liberationists are the most useful to us."
 annex.293.o3:0 "The Unionists will protect against revisionism."
 annex.294.t:0 "The Conquest of Arunachal Pradesh"
 annex.294.d:0 "Hotly contested between India and China for over 50 years, Arunachal Pradesh is now in our hands. With so many contenders for control over the region, there are multiple options for new leadership over the territory, or we could choose to continue our occupation if we so wish."
 annex.294.o1:0 "India is their rightful ruler."
 annex.294.o2:0 "The Chinese can govern them better."
 annex.294.o3:0 "The Chinese can govern them better."
 annex.294.o4:0 "Tibet deserves control over the region."
 annex.294.o5:0 "Let the Assamese govern the region."
 annex.294.o6:0 "We shall govern the region ourselves."
 annex.295.t:0 "The Conquest of Galicia"
 annex.295.d:0 "A region of Spain with a long history and regional identity, Galicia has fallen under our control. There is no shortage of potential collaborators who would be willing to create a client state in our stead, or we could continue our occupation if we so wish."
 annex.295.o1:0 "Galicia shall have their independence."
 annex.295.o2:0 "Actually, Spain should control this region."
 annex.295.o3:0 "Galicia is ours. Nothing will change that."
 annex.296.t:0 "A New American Leader"
 annex.296.d:0 "With our new client state in the South being established, the time has come to pick a new leader for their nation. To this end, there are four options for us to take. David Duke, leader of the National Renewal Party, is the clear choice if we wish to maintain the facade of a civilian government, holding beliefs in line with ours while also running a legitimate political party. Duke's old allies, the Ku Klux Klan led by Frank Ancona, would be easily malleable to our suzerainty, though their radicalism may cause instability down the line. If we wish to ease our new client regime's economic woes, we could form a government out of the many corporations in the American Republic, encouraging their old executives and their capital to return. Of course, we could also just let the military take over and rule with an iron fist. Which faction shall we choose?"
 annex.296.o1:0 "Duke's National Renewal should take over."
 annex.296.o2:0 "The Ku Klux Klan shall stand up to the task."
 annex.296.o3:0 "Corporate rule is a good investment."
 annex.296.o4:0 "The military understands strength."
 annex.297.t:0 "A New American Leader"
 annex.297.d:0 "With our new client state in the South being established, the time has come to pick a new leader for their nation. Though the Republican Party is the obvious choice for their new government, there are two distinct wings of the party that we can empower. The first is the Rumsfeld wing, with a focus on traditional establishment conservativism and an interventionist foreign policy. The second is the Bush wing, with a more populist and anti-establishment bent. Which wing should we empower?"
 annex.297.o1:0 "Rumsfeld's moderates would be better."
 annex.297.o2:0 "Bush's populists are the better choice."
