### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_HYSNI_MILLOSHI_DESC:0 "Hysni Milloshi has been an obscure figure for most of his life. He was not a politician, but an author and a poet with a low-ranking membership in the Party of Labour. He was also a loyal supporter of long-time First Secretary Enver Hoxha. Milloshi’s adherence to Hoxha’s political line made him skeptical of Hoxha’s successor, Ramiz Alia, who had pursued a policy of measured reform after coming to power in 1985. Though Albania was still one of the most repressive states in the Warsaw Pact, Milloshi published several public letters and poems critical of the First Secretary. To his surprise he found not only supporters among the public, but also sponsors among the higher ranks of the party. Together they formed a popular movement against reform which catapulted Milloshi to national prominence, eventually forcing Alia to concede to the now growing faction of hardliners in the government. With the help of his benefactors, Milloshi rose through the ranks of the party to eventually become a member of the Central Committee. After Alia’s untimely death in 2002, the party looked for a younger leader who could bring unity to the country. Eventually Hysni Milloshi was given the tacit approval of Nexhmije Hoxha, becoming the undisputed leader of Albania. His time in power has seen the complete reversal of Alia’s limited reforms and a return to the totalitarianism of the Hoxha era. Though Albania remains isolated and economically backwards, Milloshi has kept the country afloat through development aid from the Warsaw Pact while continuing to prepare for a potential Yugoslav invasion."
POLITICS_LOUISA_HANOUNE_DESC:0 "A prominent figure within the Algerian radical socialist movement, Louisa Hanoune led numerous protests against the dictatorship that had ruled her country for decades, inspiring a nation to get behind her polarising views. While eventually the regime did come to an end, it took almost five years for Hanoune to become Workers' Party leader in 1990 and subsequently President in 1991. Since the 'Silent Revolution' as it is called in Algeria's contemporary history books, Hanoune has intertwined her party into every aspect of Algerian society, while ensuring not to establish a cult of personality around herself or any other prominent figures. Her unique revolutionary regime has inspired other movements around the world, and she remains the most powerful woman in Africa."
POLITICS_JOSE_EDUARDO_DOS_SANTOS_DESC:0 "A veteran of the Angolan War of Independence, José Eduardo dos Santos rose to prominence under fellow revolutionary Agostinho Neto, the leader of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola. Due to his time studying in the Soviet Union, Neto made dos Santos coordinator of the MPLA’s foreign department and then foreign minister upon the independence of Angola in 1975. He played a key role in securing foreign recognition for the MPLA government, as they faced insurgencies from the South African-aligned UNITA and FNLA guerillas. Though accused of being an adherent of the radical fractionalist line of the MPLA, dos Santos showed his loyalty to Neto by dutifully upholding the president’s policy of international non-alignment, even after Neto’s death in 1979. Since then dos Santos has served as president of Angola, isolating the country from the rest of the world and removing it from the ‘petty international politics’ of the Soviet Union. Though his hold on power is stronger than ever with the removal of the last fractionalists in the eighties and the retreat of most rebel guerillas in the nineties, dos Santos’ three decades in power has taken a toll on the president. Many fear that his weakening resolve and the lack of a designated successor may prove to be the downfall of the seemingly unbeatable revolutionary regime."
POLITICS_SERGIO_MASSA_DESC:0 "Sergio Massa was unknown to many in the country, until at the age of just 25 he led a revived democratic movement to bringing down a brutal socialist regime. Peronists at the time thought little of the man, but by the drafting of a new constitution in 1999, Massa had solidified his powerbase and gained powerful allies throughout the political sphere. In 2004, he won his first election to become President of Argentina, presenting himself as the savior of a new Argentina that was still lagging behind its neighbours in South America. Initially the economy improved and the people were content with their revolutionary leader remaining head of state for as long as possible, but a short-lived military coup in 2006 ended his leadership. The following year, the ruling junta collapsed due to a devastating economic crisis unfolding across the continent, leading to another restoration of true democracy. In the 2009 election, Massa won to enter his second non-consecutive term as President of Argentina."
POLITICS_HARRY_MITCHELL_DESC:0 "Harry Mitchell was Mayor of Tempe, Arizona from 1978 until 1992, with a brief gap in 1988 during the Admiralty Incident. Using this as a springboard to propel his political career further, he sought the Social Renewal Party nomination in 1997, but failed to win any significant number of votes outside his home city. However, his luck would turn around in 2001 when the Social Renewal and Democratic Union parties merged to create the Social Union. Supporters of his 1997 campaign turned out in huge numbers to convince the rest of the country that this time Mitchell could unite them all. At the time, Arizona was a deeply divided nation, shattered by corruption revelations and the flight of emigrants from every direction. By mid 2001, Mitchell had secured the nomination and in November he became President of Arizona. Since inauguration in 2002 his programs of moderate welfare expansion, an enormous infrastructure endeavour and an unprecedented fight against corruption have led to victories for the Social Union in every single national election. While there are no term limits in Arizona, Mitchell seems ready to retire in time for the 2013 election, and his successor may not be so popular."
POLITICS_JULIA_GILLARD_DESC:0 "Julia Gillard has been a controversial figure in Australian politics for years, consistently using outlandish statements on the campaign trail to garner unprecedented support within disillusioned voters. Formerly a member of the defunct People's Alternative, a revolutionary socialist party, Gillard has shifted further to the right in the past thirty years, joining Labor in 1989. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1998, becoming Shadow Agriculture Minister in 2001. By the time of the Liberal National Coalition's collapse in 2004, she had risen to the position of Deputy Leader, and upon Labor's landslide loss to the rapidly growing Australian Conservatives in 2007, she was selected to succeed her mentor John Brumby as party leader. In a snap 2009 election, Gillard claimed an unprecedented victory, being elected Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority of seats. However, in recent months her popularity has plunged due to a worsening economic crisis and a growing rift with the Governor General. Australia's first female Prime Minister will have to battle against all odds to maintain her position until the next federal election."
POLITICS_PETER_MERTENS_DESC:0 "As a teenager in the economically shattered Belgium, Peter Mertens became an adherent of radical Marxist-Leninist thought. By the landslide national victory for the Workers' Party of Belgium in 1984, Mertens had already joined the Marxistich-Leninistische Beweging, a growing force in local politics. Initially sceptical of the Workers' Party in power, he came to join their ranks after the attempted 'reactionary coup' in 1986, when he was just 17. Upon Germany's reunification and rapid Warsaw Pact expansion throughout Western Europe, Mertens sought closer alliances with those above him. Eventually in the late 1990s, he was granted his wish after gradually climbing through the ranks. Becoming Junior Politburo Member in 1997, Mertens had achieved national recognition and was slated by some as the possibly youthful successor to Secretary Ludo Martens. However, it would take another decade for Peter to lead his nation. After revolutionary Ludo's death in 2008, allies of the current Secretary moved quick to secure his place as the natural successor, purging possible opposition and rounding up all Politburo members who refused to comply with the new policies already put forward within the State Assembly. On Christmas Day, Peter Mertens became First Secretary and President of Belgium."
POLITICS_JIGME_SINGYE_WANGCHUCK_DESC:0 "Dragon King Jigme Singye Wangchuck received his education in Western institutions, from India to England. Upon his father's death, he became Dragon King in 1972, vowing to the dying head of state in earlier weeks that he would continue his legacy of democratisation and opening up of Bhutan. In the following decades, this is exactly what he did. By establishing various checks and balances and the first stages of a constitutional government, the King ushered in a new era of love between the royal family and its subjects. Since those first years the people of Bhutan have grown to not just revere, but adore their head of state, proud of the many accomplishments he has made, especially in recent years when the national gross domestic product was shown to have increased at an astonishing rate just since the early 2000s. However, at the turn of this decade there are rumours throughout Bhutan that the Dragon King is preparing to abdicate in favour of his eldest son. But an end to their beloved monarch could stoke the flames of great political change."
POLITICS_OSCAR_ZAMORA_MEDINACELI_DESC:0 "Originally a member of the Bolivian Communist Party and even founder of the Communist Youth organisation, Oscar Zamora Medinaceli split from the party in 1964. His growing connections with Chinese officials and devoted Maoists had angered many within the highest levels of party administration, and his expulsion was met by an outcry from fellow Bolivian Maoists. In 1965 he formed the Socialist Party, which eventually became the Revolutionary Left Front after another catastrophic split. However, despite the worsening situation for far left politics in Bolivia, the tide was about to turn. The recently formed socialist governments of Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay invaded Bolivia to topple the right wing dictatorship of Rene Barrientos. Their operation was successful, and Medinaceli was appointed by the occupying forces as Bolivian President. Just three years later in 1973, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru would mount another successful offensive against Pinochet's regime in Chile. Since then, President Medinaceli has ruled with an iron fist over Bolivia, demanding total allegiance from both the military and populace. However, after revolutions toppled socialist governments in Argentina, Peru and Uruguay, the situation is growing dire every year, and Bolivia could be the next to go."
POLITICS_ROMERO_JUCA_DESC:0 "President Romero Jucá was once an unknown politician in the state of Roraima, as both socialist governments and right wing dictatorships ruled Brazil for countless decades. However, when the Democratic Movement toppled the last military junta in 1987, Jucá quickly rose to the top of the state's food chain, being elected Governor in 1989. His career there would not last long, being ousted by his leftist opponents in 1993. On the other hand, his failure in his home state proved to be the greatest opportunity of Jucá's life, being called to the capital for a personal meeting with Itamar Franco. This exchange solidified his growing powerbase within national politics, as prominent figures grew to like his populist tone and the fiery debates he had conducted in Roraima. By 2006 he was elected leader of the Democratic Movement, and in 2007 won his first nationwide election to become the President of Brazil. After ending more than a decade of leftist national government, Jucá is seen as the savior of centrist politics, but has gradually leaned to the left in recent years to appease disgruntled voters across Brazil."
POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_PAUNOV_DESC:0 "Aleksander Paunov was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party's academic faction before his rise to power. As a junior member of the State Council, he frequently conflicted with the opinions of fellow members, but always ensured total loyalty to General Secretary Todor Zhivkov. When longtime leader Zhivkov died in 1998, his close friend Petar Mladenov succeeded him in the renamed office of People's Secretary, but would himself fall to illness in late 1999 and die. At this point the Communist Party old guard were struggling to maintain control, and the threat of a popular uprising against their stagnating government was all too real for most. Eventually, they decided the younger 50-year old Aleksander Paunov, now Deputy Advisor to Bulgaria's State Council, should become their paramount leader for the coming millennium. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2000, Paunov orchestrated a devastating purge throughout the country. In just one year, his ruthlessness became the face of the Warsaw Pact, strengthening the resolve of other allied leaders and showing to Europe's disgruntled populace that their disobedience would be met with the harshest consequences. By 2003, Paunov secured total control over Bulgaria and the last remnants of the old guard were wiped out. Seen by many as the most tyrannical leader in the Warsaw Pact, Aleksander Paunov is certainly one to be feared, and shows no signs of retiring from his office any time soon."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_II_DESC:0 "Born as Jean-Serge Bokassa, the current Emperor of Central Africa became a Prince with the style Imperial Highness in 1976. After avoiding a possibly disasterous military coup in 1979, the head of state grew increasingly paranoid and weary of his closest advisors and even family members. By the late 1980s he had sidelined many within the Imperial Court, and ensured a clear line of succession within the family so no one would dare to remove him from power. Nevertheless, when he attempted to commit suicide in 1994 via drug overdose, his younger son but designated heir apparent Jean-Bedel Bokassa Jr. attempted to seize control. The suicide attempt failed and Emperor Bokassa was furious that his son would disobey his wishes, subsequently executing his heir and all those who declared loyalty to him during the 'coup'. After this incident, the Emperor chose a son and cabinet minister he formerly called 'weak', Jean-Serge Bokassa to succeed him as head of state. The new Crown Prince diligently waited for his father to die, and eventually he did in a plane crash above Sudan, just hours before New Years Day 1996. For 14 years, Bokassa II has reigned over the Empire, making numerous efforts to reform and democratise many aspects of the nation. However, while the economy is being decentralised and ministerial posts are being given more powers, the House of Bokassa still remains the sole legal and 'holy' leadership of Central Africa."
POLITICS_PRESTON_MANNING_DESC:0 "Preston Manning, a champion of the conservative and populist values common in Western Canada, founded and led the Reform Party of Canada to many victories in both provincial and federal elections in the decade following the Great American Collapse. For a time it appeared that his party was on course to usurp the Progressive Conservatives as the major right-wing force in the country after Brian Mulroney's disastrous premiership resulted in a landslide victory for the New Democratic Party in 1989. However, the stabilization period after America's demise and NATO's collapse led to mainstream parties experiencing an enormous resurgence, especially the revitalized PCs. After a devastating loss in the 2000 election, Manning resigned as party leader and subsequently dissolved Reform. For many years he remained retired from politics to become simply a footnote in Canada's history, failing to gain enough seats to govern even at his party's height. However, when the Liberal Party became mired by the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history, Manning was inspired to once again rejoin the political arena and take down the corrupt establishment. In 2003 Manning officially joined the PCs, and after the conservative MacKay government fell to the NDP in 2006 he was seen as a clear candidate to restore a true conservative vision to the country. Less than a month later PC members elected him as their next party leader, and in 2008 Manning rode the back of a populist wave to finally become prime minister of Canada. The aging leader has a clear vision for the country but the question remains; does he have the time and influence to achieve it?"
POLITICS_DANIEL_ORTEGA_DESC:0 "Initially 'Coordinator of the Junta of National Reconstruction', Daniel Ortega has led Nicaragua since 1975, and subsequently Central America since its establishment in 1997. After training with Cuban forces in guerilla warfare, the revolutionary returned to his home nation to fight against the Somoza presidential dynasty. By 1974 the tide had turned against the dictatorship, and Ortega's forces seized complete control in late 1975. When the constitutional convention was cancelled, the international community expressed dismay, believing that the Sandinista National Liberation Front would restore real democracy in Nicaragua. Despite their grievances, the socialist junta continued until a suitable civilian administration could be put in place. After fighting against a right wing rebellion in the mid-1980s, President Ortega finally made concessions and dissolved the Junta to officially become President. From that day forward he worked tirelessly to unite Central America under one government, leading resistance forces in neighbouring nations to victory against their respective right-wing dictatorships. In 1997, the Socialist Republic of Central America was established with Ortega as its sole head of state, advocating for a centralised government rather than the federal alternatives of the past. Since then, no opposition against the President has gained any power, and the various rebels that remain across the country are weakening by the day. It seems Ortega will rule until he dies."
POLITICS_JOHN_CHIANG_DESC:0 "After the death of Chiang Kai-shek, his son Chiang Ching-kuo became President of the Chinese Republic, continuing his father's authoritarian rule. However, during his rule from 1975 to 1988 the government inevitably opened itself up to political dissident and the establishment of powerful opposition within the country. Freedom of speech was enshrined in various laws and demonstrations against government policy were once again permitted for the first time in decades. Upon his own death, the grandson of Chiang Kai-shek won a power struggle to succeed him. While the former President's deputy Lee Teng-hui was slated to become his successor, there were still many within the Republic that demanded a presidential bloodline to last for decades onwards. A driving force behind this movement was the military, which stood alongside the late President's son Chiang Hsiao-yen in his bloody coup against the short-lived bensheng ren administration. In just two days Acting President Lee Teng-hui was murdered as well as a significant portion of the Executive Yuan. Eventually, the illegitimate son came out on top as China's victorious ruler, consolidating his power over the following years. Since those turbulent times the island nation has come to hate their President, and his own advisors are drifting away."
POLITICS_ISABEL_ALLENDE_DESC:0 "In 1970, Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile, adopting a policy of nationalisation and collectivisation. His national leadership however was short-lived, when a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet removed him from office and exiled his family to Mexico. Advised by the Soviet Union and other socialist parties in the Americas, the radical left regimes of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru successfully invaded Pinochet's Chile and executed him upon the surrender of his capital forces. Only a month after the initial military coup, Allende's family had returned to the country, with former First Lady Hortensia Bussi appointed head of state by the occupying powers. She would remain leader of the Socialist Party for fourteen years, gradually reconstructing the country and restoring the people's faith in their government. When she was assassinated in 1987, Chile was breifly governed by four different Presidents over the space of just three years. The chaos resulting from this party instability led to a military intervention. Once the dust had settled and allies of the former President had been arrested, the daughter of Salvador, Isabel Allende was elected President by the recently convened Emergency National Assembly. Since 1990, she has ruled Chile democratically, winning every election since, but many in the international community have begun to question the legitimacy of many of these electoral results."
POLITICS_HENG_SAMRIN_DESC:0 "A former political commissar and division commander of the Khmer Rouge, Heng Samrin made his mark on Kampuchea through his opposition to the ruthless government of Pol Pot. In 1978, a series of violent purges forced Samrin into exile in Vietnam, where he became the leader of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation. Later that year he returned to Kampuchea to organize the resistance against the Khmer Rouge, and his organization served to legitimize the subsequent Vietnamese invasion which placed him as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and de-facto leader of Kampuchea. He continued to consolidate power with Vietnamese support, becoming General Secretary of the new Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Party in 1981. Though he proved to be an effective leader, his power has gradually declined after the rise of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the end of the Vietnamese occupation in 1993. Despite this, Samrin has committed himself to ensuring that no other nations attempt to interfere in the internal politics of Kampuchea again, waging a guerilla war on the Thai border against the remnants of the Khmer Rouge and anti-communist forces. He almost paid the ultimate price for it, falling victim to an attempted assassination by a suspected Khmer Rouge sympathiser in 2007. The attack left him badly injured, and he was forced to give up even more of his power. But now he has seemingly recovered, and despite his old age and injuries, Heng Samrin remains committed to his duties, though there are many in the party who are worried about the state of their revolutionary leader."
POLITICS_JUAN_MANUEL_SANTOS_DESC:0 "Juan Manuel Santos has been an influential politician in Colombia for decades, holding key positions within various governments. A member of the wealthy Santos family, which is alleged to illegally run almost all of Colombia's major media sectors, Juan Manuel worked his way up the ladder during the 1990s. His ability to create 'impossible deals' endeared him to many in the Colombian political sphere, but also made him a lot of enemies. By 2002, President Alvaro Uribe appointed him Vice President, hoping for the older man to succeed him in later years. However, in 2006 their relationship had soured and Santos secretly leaked incriminating evidence against his former friend and the head of state. The President however refused to accept fault, resulting in a stunning move from the Vice President. In 2007 he resigned from his post and formed a new party, taking three quarters of the leader's party with him. With the Congress of Colombia now firmly against President Uribe, he was impeached in a historic vote, and a snap election was held to decide a successor to Acting President Roy Barreras. The people subsequently voted overwhelmingly for Santos, who became President not long after. Since then he has remained a controversial figure in Colombian politics, from his betrayal of a former ally and close friend, to the deep connections his family has with money and media."
POLITICS_HANS_MODROW_DESC:0 "Hans Modrow’s career in the Socialist Unity Party stretches across many decades, beginning in the Free German Youth. His party connections allowed him to study in both Moscow and Berlin, graduating with a doctorate in economics. Over the years he served in several positions, joining the Volkskammer and the Central Committee, heading the department of agitation and eventually becoming first secretary of the SED in Dresden. He was one of the few party members that dared to openly criticize General Secretary Erich Honecker. Because of this he was prevented from rising further in the party and the Stasi hounded him for any evidence of treason. Yet he also developed important contacts in the Soviet Union, positioning himself as a future leader in the eyes of Moscow. Honecker was eventually encouraged to resign in 1990, his offices divided along the principles of collective leadership. Former Stasi second-in-command Markus Wolf came to dominate this new government, leading the brutal integration of Austria and suppression of dissent across southern Germany. Modrow, now the leading reformist in the SED, was made finance minister and oversaw the continued automation of the former West German economy. When Premier Wolf died in 2006, Modrow was unanimously chosen as the new head of government. Despite the relative ease of his election, Modrow soon came under fire from rival factions in the SED. Promising political reform but being unable to produce anything but cosmetic changes, he now finds himself isolated as his political rivals come ever closer to unseating him."
POLITICS_DAVID_OWEN_DESC:0 "David Owen is the second longest-serving Prime Minister in British history. His rise to national prominence began with the Limehouse Declaration of 1981 when he, alongside future Deputy Prime Minister Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins and Bill Rodgers split from the Labour Party. The so-called ‘Gang of Four’ formed the Social Democratic Party with the intention of unseating the Labour government of Jim Callaghan. This was not to be, and the SDP soon merged with the Liberal Party to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988. Those who opposed this union followed Owen into a reformed SDP, but it achieved little success at first. It was only after the 1991 general election that the party had its chance. Their campaign in the wake of the fall of democracy in Europe was unprecedented. Owen openly called for the abandoning of any ties between the United Kingdom and the remnants of NATO, instead supporting closer ties with Ireland. Very few expected Owen to win, but two decades of mismanagement and scandals from the other parties had built up resentment among ordinary Britons which the SDP managed to harness, and they have not lost an election since. Owen’s 19 years in power have been both praised and criticized. He was the principal architect of the British Isles Protection Union, alongside the leaders of Ireland and Ulster, but his time in power has also seen the UK becoming increasingly isolated from Europe and the rest of the world. Though often called a strong leader, he has sometimes been forced into uncomfortable compromises with the Conservatives, Labour and even the British National Party. But through it all Owen remains one of the most popular Prime Ministers in modern history, and he has given no sign that he intends to step down any time soon."
POLITICS_GIORGIO_NAPOLITANO_DESC:0 "Since his entry into the Congress of Deputies in 1953, Giorgio Napolitano has been a leading member of the Italian Communist Party’s right-wing. His reformist views would often put him at odds with General Secretary Enrico Berlinguer. Despite being a moderate, he would develop a close relationship with Moscow as head of international relations for the party, in contrast with Berlinguer’s more antagonistic stance. In 1984 the PCI became the first communist party in Western Europe to win a democratic election. In the wake of this victory it was Berlinguer who called on Napolitano to help form a coalition with the Italian Socialist Party, something Napolitano had long advocated. His success was rewarded with a position in Berlinguer’s government as foreign minister, yet it wouldn’t last long. The General Secretary’s death only months later and the subsequent resignation of President Sandro Pertini paved the way for Napolitano himself to become both party leader and President of Italy. He used his presidential powers to push for a new Constituent Assembly, drawing up a constitution which committed the government to the transition to socialism and enshrined a leading role to PCI. As president, Napolitano steered Italy through the tumultuous eighties, when the country was gripped by a worsening economic crisis and the resurgence of far-right terrorism. But the situation stabilized with the introduction of price controls and the gradual nationalization and reorganization of failing businesses, transforming the Italian economy into one of the largest in Europe by the mid-2000s. Though faced with criticism from both the left and right, Napolitano has built one of the richest and freest nations in the Warsaw Pact, and he diligently continues this work despite his old age."
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_MORGAN_DESC:0 "Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan started out as the personal bodyguard of General Siad Barre, the military strongman who, in 1969, seized power in Somalia and established a Marxist-Leninist state. Though General Barre initially relied almost entirely on the military for support, the disastrous Ogaden War of 1977-1978 led to a purge of the army and an attempted coup. He instead turned to the loyal men around him like Morgan, who was promoted to commander in Mogadishu and married to Barre’s daughter. Morgan would then lead the most elite forces in the Somali National Army, becoming known as the ‘Butcher of Hargeisa’ for his violent suppression of separatism in Somaliland. He was made Minister of Defense in 1990 and ultimately Commander-in-Chief later that same year, cementing his position as General Barre’s successor. When the ‘Victorious Leader’ died five years later Morgan took his place as president of Somalia after a power struggle with Barre’s son. Though he was known as a ruthless commander, Morgan’s rule began with some measured reforms to the state. He loosened the harsh restrictions imposed by General Barre and re-established ties with Ethiopia in a bid to gain outside support for his campaign against armed insurgents. Despite this, opposition towards his regime is widespread and much of the country is still ruled by rebel groups, disloyal generals, and uncooperative politicians."
POLITICS_IULIAN_VLAD_DESC:0 "General Iulian Vlad spent almost the entirety of the Cold War climbing the ranks of the Romanian military. He began in 1951 at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and ultimately became head of the Department of State Security in 1987. As the leader of one of the most prolific secret police forces in the Warsaw Pact, his power was rivalled only by President Nicolae Ceausescu himself. As such he became the president’s right-hand man, harshly persecuting anyone who dared to dissent against the government. When Ceausescu died in 1996, the party followed his succession plans and elected his son Nicu as president. But the young Ceausescu cared little for the duties of the office, despite his father’s tutoring, and the task of running the state increasingly fell on Vlad. Meanwhile the party grew disgruntled at being represented by a known alcoholic who spent millions of state funds on gambling, parties and unsuccessful projects. Nicu would eventually fall victim to his own vices and die in 2002, leaving the party without an official successor. Already being the de-facto leader of the country, Iulian Vlad was chosen as the next General Secretary and elected president. Despite his pledges of upholding the legacy of the 'Genius of the Carpathians', his time as leader of Romania has seen a slow move away from the excesses of the Ceausescu era, reducing the role of the personality cult, reintroducing austerity and moving the country towards a more mainstream form of communism."
POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_DESC:0 "When asking about the most powerful man in the world, the answer will always resoundingly be Dmitry Yazov. Joining the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War in 1941 at age 17, Dmitry Yazov’s service to the Soviet Union has lasted for almost 70 years. Rising first throughout the ranks of the army, and then of the party, Yazov has brought a military demeanour with him into power in 1993, after Grigory Romanov passed away. Dmitry Yazov is regarded as the leader of the Military Clique, an influential faction of military leaders and officials from the Military-Industrial Complex within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Despite leading the singular world superpower for seventeen years, Yazov’s rule has not seen many improvements to the Soviet people. Corruption has risen, the economy has stagnated, and unrest has been on the rise within multiple Soviet Socialist Republics. Nevertheless, Yazov is regarded as a stable ruler, particularly when compared to his predecessor, and so long as he remains in charge, it is expected that the Soviet Union will keep trudging ever onwards towards the lofty promises of Communism."
POLITICS_ANNE_GRETE_HOLMSGAARD_DESC:0 "Anne Grete Holmsgaard is a long time member of the Left Socialist Party, the governing party of Denmark since 1983. Joining the now defunct Folketing as a MP in 1979 as part of the general surge attained by the Left Socialists, Anne Grete Holmsgaard was instrumental in shaping the foreign policy of the young Danish Socialist Republic from the early 80s and onwards. Cycling out due to the rotation principle of the Left Socialists in 1986, Holmsgaard returned to the halls of power after the 1991 elections, now as a senior figure within the party. And when former president Søren Kolstrup retired after the 2001 elections, Holmsgaard was elected President by the People’s Assembly despite grumbling from the MPs associated with the ‘public solidarity organisations’, a term for the half of parliament seats assigned to the trade unions, farmers’ associations and student unions. Since then, Holmsgaard’s presidency has been marked by stable economic growth, with a rise in exports, not just to Denmark’s usual trade partners but also to the Warsaw Pact, as Holmsgaard has rekindled Denmark’s ties to the European Union and Germany in particular, to the cheers of the Communist Party and the chagrin of the still sizable anti-Soviet faction within the Left Socialists. However, it has also been marked with a streak of antisemitism, typically uncharacteristic for Danish politics, with a malign rhetoric towards the small Jewish minority from the President. As Holmsgaard is entering her sixties, some are wondering whether the aging stateswoman is soon to retire, come the 2011 General Election. "
POLITICS_OYSTEIN_MEIER_JOHANNESSEN_DESC:0 "Øystein Meier Johannessen has always been a radical and eccentric personality. During the eighties, as a wave of political violence and upheaval swept across Norway, Johannesen associated with the Red Electoral Alliance, a big-tent party of revolutionary socialists, Marxists and Maoists. This ad-hoc coalition successfully toppled the Norwegian government in 1984, forcing the royal family into exile and cementing their power through a general election the following year. Johannesen quickly aligned himself with the faction of Prime Minister Erling Folkvord against the Maoist Old Guard of the party. The new government was soon faced with a power struggle, ending with the expulsion of the Maoists in 1987. The revolutionary socialists soon cemented their power with the promulgation of a new electoral law which heavily favored the ruling party. This system, conceived by Johannesen, has kept the Red Alliance in power for over two decades. As a key figure in the revolutionary government, Johannesen kept secretly amassing power behind the scenes through threats, intimidation and bribery. In 1992 he succeeded in calling a leadership election which forced Folkvord to resign, paving the way for his own rise to the position. Since then the Norwegian government has grown increasingly repressive while Johannesen has continued to consolidate power, becoming president in 1997 and overseeing a drastic decline in the country’s international standing. Now isolated and confined by the duties of state, Johannesen’s rule has become more arbitrary than ever, and many are doubting whether he is even mentally fit to be the leader of Norway."
POLITICS_RICHARD_SPENCER_DESC:0 "In only twenty years, Richard Spencer has risen from a young university student to one of the most beloved and powerful men among the American far-right. Spencer was already a staunch nationalist conservative during his stay in the University of Virginia, where he continually bucked the societal trends of the People's Commonwealth. Spencer, discontent with socialist programs, left university life in 2001 to pursue a political career in right-wing politics. There, in the Virginia political scene, he connected with the National Alliance, one of the most prominent far-right terrorist organizations in the American People's Commonwealth following their expulsion from Great Falls, Montana. Anti-Covington political figures there instructed Spencer in the ways of revolutionary, hardline neo-nazism, contributing to the radicalization of his already conservative views. Following the death of Pierce, the Alliance's leader, in mid-2002, Spencer journeyed to Montana, where he joined dissident groups within Covington's patchwork coalition. Following his own expulsion in 2003, Spencer, who had already built up a minor coalition of his own, took his militia group and seized the city of Spokane, as far from Great Falls as could be, in order to start a true political revolution. Although he expected little to follow his revolt, built around his own bizarre "White emancipationist" political views, thousands rallied to the young officer's banner, under a staunch anti-capitalist, anti-communist, and white supremacist program. After a long and bloody conflict, Spencer's Union finally has independence, although the unity of his own patchwork coalition remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HAROLD_COVINGTON_DESC:0 "Hundreds of thousands worship the fascist systems of the Northwest, praising the liberation of white Americans, but few of them mention Harold Covington, the Northwest's liberator, in anything but a negative light. Following disbarment from the army and deportation from Rhodesia, his adopted white homeland, Harold Covington founded the idea of the Northwest Territorial Imperative, a white nationalist homeland in the American northwest. The ideal was supported by numerous organizations across the region, the most powerful being Richard Butler's Aryan Nations and Robert Jay Matthews' The Order. Following the Great Collapse of 1987, Covington, Butler, and Matthews were among the first to establish a legitimate white nationalist government in the region, its seat in Montana. The father of the Imperative, Covington, became the first leader of Montana, and thousands of white nationalists flocked to a new homeland for their endangered people. Following the death of Jay Matthews in late 1989 in his quest to secure Western Cascadia and fully unify the Imperative, many began to point fingers at Covington for the loss, and his popularity dwindled. By the mid-1990s, Covington was forced to expel prominent leaders such as his premier opponent, William Luther Pierce, and strengthen his alliance with Aryan Nations and nationalist militias to compensate, actions that sparked mass anger among hardline fascists. Eventually, he faced a hardline political revolution by Richard Spencer, a charismatic young officer who commandeered a mutiny in Spokane, Washington, and lost most of his territory and support in the resulting carnage. With Richard Butler dead in 2004 and militias taking an even more powerful role as an obese Covington struggles with his health, many do not believe the pragmatic rule of Covington's White Freedom Alliance to last through the next decade."
POLITICS_BILL_HAMMONS_DESC:0 "There is no man who has eroded the power and influence of his own office more than Bill Hammons. Manager of the campaign of Democratic Coalition founding father and subsequent President of the Midwest, Wesley Clark, Hammons was credited for the broad, grassroots, and centrist appeal of the popular military general's election in 2003. Guiding the campaigns of the Democratic Coalition across the country through "Runners for Clark", Hammons brought the party great victories in local and congressional elections, providing a decentralized alternative to local populations fearful of government overreach in their own affairs. When Clark expressed his desire not to seek re-election as President in 2007, Hammons was seen as the likely successor, and hastily maneuvered his way through the party leadership process. Despite the Democratic Coalition's landslide victory in 2007, the party remains deeply fractured between conservative and liberal wings, and Hammons has been categorized as someone who has only served to exacerbate tensions by standing firmly in the middle. Following the resurgence of the American Restorationist Party under hawkish conservative Hillary Rodham and the mutiny of liberals to the social-democratic Party of Hope, Hammons' base of support has steadily eroded, even among General Wesley Clark, his old benefactor. He has not yet declared his intention to run again in 2011, with public opinion low except in the most decentralized of regions, and many suspect he will open the Democratic Coalition to yet another factional struggle."
POLITICS_TOSHIO_TAMOGAMI_DESC:0 "General Toshio Tamogami has had a long and distinguished career in the Japanese National Defense Forces. Beginning in 1971, he eventually rose to become commander-in-chief of the Air Defense Command in 2004. Though he wasn’t a politician, he affiliated himself with Nippon Kaigi, an influential nationalist organization with ties to both the political and financial sectors of Japanese society. Being known as an outspoken nationalist, Tamogami gained the attention of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who appointed him chief of staff of the Air Force in 2007. At the time it seemed that Tamogami had reached the height of his career, but that was proved wrong when Shinzo Abe suddenly resigned the very same year. His resignation triggered a long political crisis where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was unable to elect a new leader. The party was divided and completely deadlocked, until a private deal was struck between several factions who agreed to support a compromise candidate in General Tamogami. He hesitated at first, but eventually agreed to resign from his position in the air force, join the LDP and accept the nomination. Many see the old general as a breath of fresh air in Japan’s stagnant one-party system. However, there are those in the party that fear that Tamogami’s ambitions aren’t just to strengthen the government and the military, but that his plans for reform go far beyond anything that has been attempted in post-war Japan."
POLITICS_LI_ZHANSHU_DESC:0 "Hailing from the rural regions of the Hebei Province, Li Zhanshu joined the Chinese Communist Party during the height of the Cultural Revolution. Beginning in 1975 he methodically worked his way up from an ordinary party functionary to the provincial leadership, but in 1997 a conflict within the government led Zhanshu to be politically marginalized. The following year he left his home province to take up the regional leadership in Shaanxi, becoming known for his efficient economic planning and modernizing vision in Xi’an. In 2003 he was transferred to the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, becoming the new governor four years later. That same year the Chinese Communist Party took a drastic turn at the 17th National Congress, when the party adopted a plan for economic liberalization endorsed by the aging Chairman Li Peng. Serving as a member of the Central Committee, Zhanshu vocally endorsed the call for reforms. His economic expertise had made him one of the candidates to succeed Li Peng as chairman, and he wasted no time ingratiating himself with the party leadership. Zhanshu’s eventual succession to the position of chairman was confirmed at the congress and he wasted no time appointing economic planners and reforming the bureaucracy in order to prepare for economic liberalization. The reforms officially came into effect in 2009, to great results. But his shakeup of the party has also given rise to an unruly group of reformists centered around his old associate Xi Jinping. The Chairman must walk a fine line between radical reformers and Maoist hardliners while ensuring that economic progress continues steadily and control is maintained by the party."
POLITICS_KIM_JONG_IL_DESC:0 "Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il is perhaps one of the most mysterious leaders in the modern world. Little is known about his early life, even where he was born. Korean sources say it was on Paektu Mountain on the border with China, other sources say it was in a Siberian military camp. He was four years old when the Second World War ended and Japanese troops withdrew from Korea. His father, Kim Il-sung, soon became premier of the newly established Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The young Kim then moved to Pyongyang and began his education just before the outbreak of the Korean War. The communist victory in the war allowed the elder Kim to consolidate power as the ‘Great Leader’ at the center of an intense cult of personality. Kim Jong-il was brought into this personality cult and by the time of the 6th Party Congress in 1980 had secured his position as heir apparent to his father, with senior positions in both the government and military. He began to consolidate power, securing the loyalty of the army and centralizing authority around himself. When his father died in 1994 Kim was prepared to succeed him as the new Supreme Leader of Korea. His first years in power saw the already authoritarian state grow even more autocratic. The economy suffered due to mismanagement, but close reliance on food imports from the USSR prevented starvation. After having secured his power, Kim brought about a slight opening of the country, lessening economic control and restrictions on personal freedom. His longtime fascination with culture and film allowed him to take an active role in the country’s entertainment industry, which saw a renaissance under Kim. Now the aging Supreme Leader has largely withdrawn from public life, causing speculation if he is even still alive. The Korean government assures the public that all is fine, but in the absence of a successor, the country risks falling into the hands of an ambitious family member, or even worse - the Korean People’s Army."
POLITICS_JEAN_LUC_MELENCHON_DESC:0 "As a vocal young member of the Socialist Party, Jean-Luc Mélenchon was one of the early advocates of a union between the PS and the French Communist Party. When Georges Marchais was elected president in 1985 Mélenchon was quick to call for a special congress where the PS ultimately decided to merge with the triumphant PCF. His efforts were recognized by the party leadership with a position in the National Council. As a voice of the party’s moderates Mélenchon came under heavy pressure during the rule of General Secretary Maxime Gremetz, who led a vicious anti-union campaign to stabilize France’s faltering economy. But Mélenchon could not be coerced, demoted or marginalized. As protests swept the nation during the spring of 2000 he was the first official to openly call for the general secretary’s resignation, but he was soon joined by many others. Aiding in the fall of one of Western Europe’s most brutal leaders helped catapult him to national prominence, even as France entered a new era of political instability. New general secretaries came and went every other year, and Mélenchon established himself as a unifying figure. He was elected general secretary in 2006 on a broad program of reform. His government has carried out sweeping changes to the French political system, opening up the party, loosening restrictions on trade unions and removing many old guard politicians from power. But unrest is growing, both in the party and the public at large, and if Mélenchon is reckless he could find himself in the same position as the dictator he once helped topple."
POLITICS_RESZO_NYERS_DESC:0 "Rezső Nyers was one of the leading members of the Social Democratic Party in post-war Hungary. In 1948 the party caved under the increasing pressure of the occupying Soviet forces and merged with the communists to form the Hungarian Working People’s Party. As a former social democrat, Nyers was viewed with suspicion by many communists, despite serving as a member of the party leadership. With the rise of János Kádár to the position of General Secretary, Nyers was appointed to the Central Committee and chosen to head the Ministry of Finance. There he drew up an economic reform package known as the New Economic Mechanism, which introduced some market forces into the Hungarian socialist economy. But the reforms were counteracted by the orthodox marxists in the party and Nyers lost his political prominence for several decades. It wasn’t until the death of János Kádár in 1989 when Nyers returned to power in the moderate government of Károly Grósz. Advocating smaller changes to the political system, Grósz was soon outpaced by the many radical reformers he promoted during his time in power. When he died in 1996 the reformers held almost complete control over the government, with Rezső Nyers becoming the next General Secretary. Despite being the oldest leader in the Warsaw Pact, Nyers’ government has been energetic in its promotion of system change. His economic reforms have led to a burgeoning free market of small businesses across Hungary. But he still has to contend with a growing faction of hardliners who accuse him of not wanting to simply reform the socialist system, but to jettison it entirely."
POLITICS_FREDERIK_WILLEM_DE_KLERK_DESC:0 "Hailing from a prominent Afrikaner family with strong ties to the National Party, Frederik Willem de Klerk was exposed to politics from an early age. His father was one of the principal architects of the Apartheid system, a system de Klerk would staunchly defend throughout his career. While serving as minister of education in Pieter Willem Botha’s government, the state president suffered a stroke and was forced to resign. In the ensuing leadership election, de Klerk beat Botha’s preferred successor and became president half a year later. With the victory of the Soviet Union in the Cold War, de Klerk saw South Africa as the last line of defense against communism on the continent. As such he refused to make any concessions to groups seen as Soviet proxies, like the African National Congress and the South West Africa People’s Organisation. These groups and their allies thus intensified their attacks against the government, with the nineties seeing the bloodiest years of the South African Border War as the government fought rebel groups across the border into Angola and Zambia. Much of the country was put under martial law and a state of emergency was declared, with de Klerk’s term extended indefinitely in 1995. A cautious liberalization followed, with concessions being granted to placate the colored and Indian populations of South Africa. The aging president still maintains support among White South Africans, but the majority black population have begun to turn towards even more radical and violent groups, bent on overthrowing the apartheid system by any means necessary."
POLITICS_ROBERT_MUGABE_DESC:0 "Robert Mugabe was an early activist for independence and majority rule in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. He was a member of multiple African nationalist organizations before ultimately becoming the leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union. He led the ZANU forces against both the white minority government and the rival Zimbabwe African People’s Union forces in what became known as the Rhodesian Bush War. Though he was held as a prisoner for over a decade, Mugabe continued the fight after being released in 1974. The war was brought to an end by the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979, which established the process for a transition to majority rule. Mugabe’s ZANU won the first elections in a landslide amidst widespread voter intimidation and violence. Though ideologically an African nationalist and a Marxist-Leninist, Mugabe sought reconciliation during his first years in power. But he took a sharp turn as economic difficulties enveloped the country amidst the collapse of capitalism in the west. As most white Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa they became a target of the government alongside supporters of ZAPU, mostly ethnic Ndebele. As his forces carried out targeted attacks against minority communities, Mugabe’s former allies in the Soviet Union quickly distanced themselves from him while increasing aid to their allied ZAPU fighters. Mugabe in turn denounced the Soviet Union and their dogma, instead adopting an ideology of Zimbabwean nationalism. Though Mugabe has consolidated power his country remains isolated, with threats from both Soviet proxies to the north and apartheid South Africa to the south."
POLITICS_MATTHEW_FESTING_DESC:0 "Prince and Grand Master Matthew Festing hails from a family with a long tradition of military service. His father was Sir Francis Festing, Field Marshal and Chief of Staff of the British Armed Forces in the early days of the Cold War. Matthew Festing followed in his father’s footsteps, serving in the British army and reaching the rank of colonel before joining the Knights of Malta in 1977. When the Order was exiled from Rome in 1984 he quickly set out to help rebuild the order on the island of Malta. There he led the efforts to rebuild and expand the Order’s Military Corps, working closely with his fellow Englishman, Grand Master Andrew Bertie. The socialist government of Malta remained sceptical of the Knights, but were unable to stop their expansion. After long negotiations the Knight’s Corps were ultimately made a division in the Maltese military, forging closer ties between Festing and the high command. In 1997 he took his perpetual vows, becoming a Knight of Justice and positioning himself as the heir apparent of the old Grand Master. When Bertie died in 2008, Festing was elected his successor at a conclave held in the historical Fort St. Angelo, now once again the seat of the Order. Determined to restore the power of the Knights, Festing used dissatisfaction with the government among the military to launch a coup, deposing the prime minister and taking control of the island. The Order seeks to turn Malta into a new Papal State, but without popular support they cannot hope to keep their hold of the country for long." 
POLITICS_DONALD_RUMSFELD_DESC:0 "Once a humble national security advisor in the Reagan and then Bush administrations, Donald Rumsfeld first rose to prominence in the American Republic with his election as Vice President to George Bush in 1994. Moderate conservatives under the banner of the Independence Union and Democratic Party remnants failed to defeat the ticket, and together, Bush and Rumsfeld perfected the authoritarian nationalist system that has now led to complete Republican political dominance. Bush, however, did not follow interventionism as staunchly as his vice president, and the two began to spar over America's role in the world - Rumsfeld desired intervention in the world's conflicts, even with only America's South in their control, while President Bush desired economic stability above all. When Bush died of a heart attack in 2001, Rumsfeld soon succeeded him as president, and it is said that the rally-round-the-flag effect that occurred saved his political career. After Rumsfeld defeated George Bush Jr. in the primaries, he easily bested the Democratic Party remnants and the Independence Union, securing further control for the Republican Party. Throughout his 8-year term, Rumsfeld has pursued global interventionism, but has been criticized for failing to heal the economic collapse facing the nation since the so-called Flight of the Executives. His disastrous intervention in Yemen, which established an unstable conservative government has shattered his standing among much of the Bush Cult, and although he remains popular, Rumsfeld does not enjoy nearly the support as the elder Bush. President Rumsfeld will run again in 2010 according to all known metrics, but it is unsure if the Republicans will allow him and his hawkish agenda to survive the next election."

She soon become a brash advocate for women's rights, progressivism, and Wellstone's signature campaign promise - a centralized republic with clear protections for civil rights. In 2005, Hortman was originally expected to run for a third term, and secure herself as a prominent representative, but instead, she decided to run for President. Wellstone had refused to run a second term, citing concerns over multiple sclerosis, and the party scrambled to find new candidates. When expected frontrunner Tom Vilsack was damaged by Wellstone publicly condemning his moderate views and inability to appeal to minority, progressive voters, the nomination process was shaken even more. Hortman, a dark-horse candidate, secured the nomination after 8 grueling rounds of convention voting. She won in 2005 by a clear majority and was elected again in 2009 by a slimmer one. Her unexpected dominance over the political system has led to outcry from nationalist groups, who decry her as an authoritarian, but also progressive groups within her own party, who label her a member of a new political establishment."
POLITICS_MIKE_LEAVITT_DESC:0 "The descendant of a Mormon pioneer, Mike Leavitt served as a businessman and political advisor to his father, a state senator, before entering politics as a presidential nominee. Since he first ran for political office in 1992 as a Republican, President Mike Leavitt has lost as many presidential primaries as he has won, with challenges in '92 and '96 against John Huntsman Sr. and Orrin Hatch, respectively, both fizzling out before he won his first election in 2004. Following the popular Hatch's decision not to run again, Leavitt triumphed against a crowded field of candidates, and has now overseen record economic growth in the hermit republic and has successfully defended against aggression from both the north and west. Fortunately for his presidential aspirations, post-collapse Utah has also seen the infiltration and collapse of the Utah Democratic Party in the wake of a LaRouchite takeover. As Orrin Hatch established United Utah, a coalition against all forms of socialist and nationalist subversion, former Democrats chief among them, Leavitt became one of its founding and most influential members. Although they remain tense, Leavitt has continued Hatch's concilatory policies towards the Church of Latter Day Saints. Many fear that the president in Salt Lake City is controlled by a different president - the one of the Mormon church. As future elections approach, United Utah seems very likely to secure victory, but many in the party leadership have grown fearful of LDS President Thomas Monson's influence over Leavitt. Whether he can keep his position remains to be seen."
POLITICS_CZESLAW_KISZCZAK_DESC:0 "As the right-hand man of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czesław Kiszczak rose to power following a wave of protests in the autumn of 1993. Weary of Soviet influence over the Polish government, thousands of protestors took to the streets after the death of Grigory Romanov and his succession by Dmitry Yazov. The longtime civilian government was replaced by military rule and martial law was imposed. Kiszczak helped facilitate the crackdown in his role as minister of the interior, then served as a member of the Military Council of National Salvation, Poland’s de-facto government. The clampdown was harsh by Warsaw Pact standards and served to alienate much of the civilian population from their rule. But tensions eventually calmed and martial law was lifted in 1998. Kiszczak helped ease the transition to a civilian government, being appointed prime minister by President Jaruzelski the same year. Yet the two generals have been ineffective in solving the issues plaguing the country. Their rule has seen the economy steadily decline and the opposition movements of the 90s have recently begun to rear their heads again. The aging Marshal Jaruzelski relinquished nearly all power in 2005, leaving General Kiszczak to preside over an ineffectual and unpopular government."
POLITICS_NOAM_CHOMSKY_DESC:0 "The first and only President of the American People's Commonwealth, Noam Chomsky originally found his fame in two vastly different fields - linguistics and social activism. Chomsky, a prominent anarcho-syndicalist activist during the tumultuous 60s, became of one of the most vocal supporters of the big-tent socialist American Labor Party. When Ronald Reagan dissolved the United States, leaders and organizers such as Chomsky and Bernie Sanders founded the American People's Commonwealth in Philadelphia. The Party of Labor and reformist organizations fell to Chomsky's Industrial Workers of the World, and he was soon elected provisional president of a new revolutionary nation. After a three-year constitutional convention finally elapsed, the IWW centralized its power, but faced considerable intra-party deadlock. Chomsky found himself at the whim of international activists like Germaine Greer, who wished to transform the nation into the catalyst of worldwide revolutionary socialism, but also the New Guard and their political organ, the Central Committee. The New Guard, filled with young, pragmatic socialists, opposed Chomsky and his idealistic anarchism at every turn, but with Chomsky's influence in state governorships and the executive branch, neither could gain the upper hand. Now, even old allies like Bernie Sanders have abandoned Chomsky's anarchist movement in favor of true democratic socialism, and the dream of a peaceful American North-East with him at the helm is no closer to fruition."
POLITICS_SLOBODAN_MILOSEVIC_DESC:0 "A controversial leader in Yugoslav politics ever since the 1980s, Slobodan Milošević first rose to prominence with the support of Serbian president Ivan Stambolić. He became notorious in 1987 when he, at a session of the Central Committee, went against his former sponsor to demand a harder line on the controversial Autonomous Province of Kosovo. Stambolić was humiliated by the affair and ultimately forced to resign, with the popular Milošević taking his place as president of Serbia. Soon afterwards the governments of Montenegro, Vojvodina and Kosovo were likewise overthrown, their respective leaderships replaced with Milošević loyalists. Tensions heightened as Milošević and his allies now held de-facto veto power in the presidency of Yugoslavia, while the other republics accused him of exploiting Serbian nationalism for his own gain. This crisis came to a head at the 14th Party Congress in 1990, where Milošević struck a controversial deal with prime minister Ante Marković to push through a new constitution, with more power vested in the central government. In turn both Kosovo and Vojvodina gave up their votes in the presidency, to the anger of many in the two provinces. The compromise was ultimately successful in lowering the tensions in the country. Milošević would go on to serve two terms as president of Serbia before being elected president of Yugoslavia in 1997. As leader he has overturned half a century of Titoist foreign policy, normalizing relations with the Soviet Union and forging closer ties with the European Union of Socialist Republics. While he is still a divisive figure, many Yugoslavs hold a lot of respect for the aging Slobodan Milošević, who helped lead the country through one of the most turbulent periods in history."
POLITICS_LIANA_KANELLI_DESC:0 "Liana Kanelli was a young law student at the University of Athens when she was swept up in a massive student revolt at the onset of the 1973 Greek Revolution. As thousands took to the streets to topple the Regime of the Colonels, Kanelli became involved with the country’s burgeoning socialist movement. Principal among these was a group of communists led by Panagiotis Lafazanis, who had risen from a modest math student to a national leader following the ousting of the military junta. These young communists organized into the Workers’ Party ahead of the constitutional assembly elections in 1974, which saw the country’s political sphere shift profoundly to the left. In the ensuing coalition Lafazanis became the youngest prime minister in Greek history, with Kanelli as his press secretary. As the Workers’ Party consolidated power, Kanelli was appointed ambassador to France and eventually chosen as foreign minister in the now socialist-dominated government. She became known as a forthright and incisive negotiator, as she expertly staved off pressure from both the United States and the Soviet Union. When the now President Lafazanis was assassinated in 2003, Kanelli initiated a vicious struggle for power with prime minister Nikos Konstantopoulos, who was eventually expelled from the party as Liana Kanelli assumed the office of president. Now she is faced with many issues brought by her own actions, as divisions in the party have caused the government and economy to fragment while Greece’s hostile neighbors closely study the isolated state, waiting for any opportunity to strike."

Her father was Aung San, often titled 'Father of the Nation' for his role in achieving Burmese independence. Having spent most of her early life outside Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi returned in 1988 to take care of her dying mother, but was inexplicably swept up in the nation’s fledgling democratic movement. That same year, long time military dictator Ne Win resigned at the height of the Four Eights Uprising, a massive popular revolt that broke out across the nation only to be brutally suppressed by another military coup. Aung San Suu Kyi became an icon for her role in the uprising, and she founded the League of Socialist Salvation to continue the fight against the dictatorship. It wasn’t until 1997 when her goal could be realized, as another popular revolt erupted. In what became known as the Lotus Revolution, the military government willingly handed power to Aung San Suu Kyi in exchange for guaranteeing their continued political influence. But this was not the democratic revolution many had hoped. The following elections established the League as the undisputed rulers of Burma, with little place for domestic opposition. Aung San Suu Kyi likewise cemented her power as president, declaring ‘Buddhist Socialism’ to be the country’s national ideology and ensuring the loyalty of both the People’s Assembly and the powerful Council of Monks. Now, over a decade into her rule, mounting opposition among the people and army may yet bring about her fall from grace."
POLITICS_AYKUT_EDIBALI_DESC:0 "Aykut Edibali was one of the principal founders of the National Struggle Movement, an Islamic nationalist group that campaigned against capitalism, communism and Zionism while supporting the military dictatorship of Alparslan Türkeş. This movement split into many factions in the late seventies and Edibali led his followers into the National Order Party of Necmettin Erbakan. The party would soon become an important political force, as the remnants of the military government turned to the Islamic right for support. But it wasn’t enough to regain their rapidly declining power. Dissatisfaction with the war against Kurdish separatists forced the army to stand down under threats of a popular uprising, acquiescing to the left-wing government’s calls for peace. With the army removed from political power, the Islamists became the largest force on the Turkish right and they would ultimately end socialist rule in 1996. Edibali was appointed minister of internal affairs in Turkey’s first Islamist government, leading the operation to apprihend the terrorist Abdullah Öcalan in 1998, becoming a national hero overnight. He used this new political capital to consolidate power, eventually encouraging the aging Erbakan to resign with the support of the growing nationalist faction in the party. Taking his place as prime minister in 2001, Edibali has led the party to victory in every election since, but now he faces increasing opposition from the growing communist movement, outraged secularists and even radical Islamists disatisfied with his rule."
POLITICS_ESSAM_SHARAF_DESC:0 "Dr. Essam Sharaf is part of a small group of western-educated academics who rose to power under President Anwar Sadat in the late eighties. Sadat’s dismissal of senior officers from political positions in the country gave room for the technocrats who soon came to dominate the government of the United Arab Republic. Sharaf was hired as an expert for the Jordanian government on behalf of Egypt, which sought closer ties to their Arab neighbors while distancing itself from the Soviet Union. He returned to Egypt after the collapse of the Federation of Arab Republics in 1992, as fellow technocrat Kamal Ganzouri became president of the UAR. He joined the Arab Socialist Union and was appointed minister of transportation, rising to become prime minister by 1999. As an engineer by trade, his foremost concern while in power was infrastructure expansion and modernization. The efficient planning implemented by his administration led to an economic boom in Egypt, securing his position as successor when President Ganzouri retired in 2004. As leader of the UAR, Sharaf’s efforts to expand his projects to Syria were met with resistance from the ruling Assad family who, seeing him as a threat to their power, stifled all development projects located in their country. Subsequent efforts at reconciliation between Cairo and Damascus have been unsuccessful and with the outbreak of an insurgency in 2009 many have begun to doubt the strength of the Arab socialist project."
POLITICS_WINSTON_PETERS_DESC:0 "The firebrand Winston Peters' rise from renegade National Party MP to military-backed dictator of New Zealand has been nothing short of spectacular. First elected in 1978, Peters advocated for social conservatism and harsher measures against communism while staunchly defending of the welfare state. His unorthodox but deeply populist views led to him to become one of the most beloved politicians in the country, much to the unease of his own party. The Perth Agreement that followed the end of the Australian Civil War in 1989 was supported by both the Nationals and Labour, but Peters labeled it a farce that provided an opening for communism in the Pacific, and advocated for further military action to halt its spread. That same year, a three way election between Labour, the Nationals, and a left-wing alliance under Jim Anderton resulted in complete political deadlock. When it became clear no party could reasonably govern, the military intervened - both to stabilize the government and prevent Anderton's communist-sympathizing coalition from taking power. Following the coup, Winston Peters was chosen as New Zealand's next Prime Minister, viewed by the military as one who could give their new regime legitimacy and political power. Although Peters has succeeded in preventing the rise of communism in New Zealand, his brutal, paranoid methods and his fanatic militarism, which has seen him greatly expand the navy and declare himself an Admiral of New Zealand and Commander-in-Chief, has seen his once-staggering popularity turn into open discontent."
POLITICS_ANGELA_DAVIS_DESC:0 "The deeply polarizing but highly influential Angela Davis has a long history of labor and civil rights activism. She was one of the closest allies of Communist Party USA General Secretary Gus Hall, even running on his ticket for president in 1980. In the next election Hall stepped aside and allowed Davis to run for president in her own right, sweeping the West Coast and securing the greatest electoral victory in the party’s history. When the beloved General Secretary was assassinated the following year, Davis was quick to marginalize her rivals and secure her position as Hall’s successor. As tensions rose following decades of civil unrest, President Ronald Reagan was forced to dissolve the United States in 1987. The CPUSA already held immense influence in the West and Davis used this power to remove her political rivals, eventually forming the Union of American People’s Republics with herself as paramount leader. Further expansion was prevented by hostile right-wing forces to the east, but Davis cemented her legitimacy in the eyes of most of the world by visiting the Soviet Union in 1988. At home her purges continued, culminating in the 1993 Sacramento Massacre where Davis was accused of killing thousands of dissidents. This left a deep division in the party, as Davis grew increasingly hostile to Soviet influence while the economy fell into a depression. Now her control of the party is tenuous, and her personally progressive stances and activist past has created conflict with her expected role as a supporter of Soviet hegemony."

The government is a diarchy headed by two co-prime ministers with equal executive power, each elected by their community to ensure the equal representation of both. According to the terms of the agreement, the government is beholden to the Parliament of Ulster, which is elected by the people, and all parties elected to the parliament must be allowed representation in the government. This clause has been called into question many times, as some parties have outright refused to participate. The government is also beholden to the Council of Ulster, which is chaired by representatives of both the British and Irish governments, as well as the condominium’s two co-chiefs of state, the President of Ireland and the Monarch of the United Kingdom. As with all compromises, the unity government has left many dissatisfied. It has been accused of being inefficient, as the power-sharing makes passing laws with a simple majority almost impossible. It has also been the subject of many controversies, most recently the election of a new government in 2009. With negotiations stalling for months and both sides threatening to withdraw support for the Christmas Day Agreement, many are doubting whether the unity government will survive into the new decade."
POLITICS_HAILEMARIAM_DESALEGN_DESC:0 "Originally hailing from the Wolayita Zone in southern Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn entered the Ethiopian political scene at a time of both crisis and transition. Having studied in both Addis Ababa and the Union of American People’s Republics, he joined the ruling Workers’ Party of Ethiopia in 1997. His rise to power was swift, as party leader Mengistu Haile Mariam was eager to promote young experts to counter the influence of former military Derg members in the government. This made Desalegn a firm loyalist of Mengistu, a fellow Welayta from southern Ethiopia. His background as a civil engineer at the Water Technology Institute made him a reliable leader for various development projects during the early noughts, and Desalegn’s successes made him increasingly popular within the party. Soon he was given a seat in the National Shengo, Ethiopia’s parliament, and made deputy leader of the Workers’ Party at the behest of Mengistu. His promotion was fiercely opposed by members of the ‘Military Faction’, former Derg members that had been sidelined in the early nineties, but most of the party united behind him. In 2006 he was promptly made Vice President after a sudden illness struck the aging General Secretary. It didn’t last long, as soon Mengistu had passed away and Desalegn assumed the role of president. Now the leader of Ethiopia, Desalegn’s young government is under increasing pressure from the continuing separatist war in Eritrea, factional infighting threatening to tear the party apart, and the looming threat of a potential famine."
POLITICS_RAUL_CASTRO_DESC:0 "Brother of former president Fidel Castro, Raul Castro's revolutionary history is as long as his brother's. Being a commander in the M-26-7, Raul Castro participated in the revolution against Batista, where he led the 'Frank País Eastern Front' in the Oriente province. After the revolution, Raul Castro was appointed Minister of Defense, a post he held until 2006. For the duration of his tenure, he silently carried out his duties, being overshadowed by his more boisturous brother. Raul Castro's claim to leadership came in 2006, as Fidel Castro stepped down after 49 years of leadership because of declining health. As second secretary of the Politburo, it seemed a given that Castro would succeed his brother, an assumption that came true when the National Assembly of People's Power unanimously elected him president after the 2006 elections. Raul Castro's presidency has seen a more moderate line than his brother, bringing an end to the military adventurism that characterised Cuban foreign policy since the seventies, as well as small-scale political reforms. His short tenure has however also seen military personnel expand their reach throughout Cuban society, particularly in the growing oil and tourism sectors, in response to the return of American-sponsered terrorism courtesy of President Rumsfeld. At the same time, the growing middle class's calls for liberalisation do not appear to be sated by his minor reforms, and the desire for constitutional reform only seems to be growing. Fidel Castro may have created the modern Cuba, but it increasingly appears that it'll be Raul who defines it."
POLITICS_BASSAM_AL_SALHI_DESC:0 "Bassam Al-Salhi was once a prominent student protest leader during the most precarious period of the Arab-Israeli Peace Process. As the son of Palestinian refugees growing up in the Am’ari Camp in what was then the Kingdom of Jordan, he became active in radical nationalist movements that sought the expulsion of Israel from all of occupied Palestine. In 1980, only a year after the establishment of the Confederation of Palestine, he led a student revolt at Birzeit University against the union, and that year’s ‘rigged’ presidential election. Though ultimately unsuccessful, the protests galvanized the Palestinian left, who coalesced into the newly-reformed Palestine Communist Party. There, Salhi befriended future president Mustafa Barghouti, who soon became the leader of the party’s moderates. The two were elected to the Knesset in 1988 on the Hadash list, and soon became some of the most prominent politicians in the country, as the only Arab communists in the government of Yitzhak Rabin. When a power struggle within Hadash brought down the government, Salhi, Barghouti and other moderates left to form the Peace and Labor party. Their vote grew following an economic downturn in the late nineties and, in 2000, Barghouti was elected president of Palestine. Salhi followed soon after, becoming prime minister in 2003 at the head of a broad coalition. Facing hostility from other Arab nations following the rise of Bassel Al-Assad in Syria, Salhi’s government has deepened its ties to Europe and Iran while carrying out ambitious social reforms, but many still doubt whether it can survive the hostile arena of Palestinian and Middle Eastern politics."
POLITICS_EBRAHIM_YAZDI_DESC:0 "Ebrahim Yazdi is one of the most complicated leaders of modern Iran. As one of the founding members of the Freedom Movement of Iran, his early years were defined by his defiance against the brutal regime of the Shah. He was forced into exile in the sixties, but continued to lead the resistance against the Shah from outside the country. He settled in Houston and remained there until 1977, when he joined the exiled Ruhollah Khomeini in Paris as an advisor. With the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution, he returned alongside Khomeini to take up the position of foreign minister in the newly-established interim government. But conflict soon developed between the government, led by Mehdi Bazargan, and Khomeini, the spiritual leader of the revolution. Yazdi ultimately sided with the government and convinced parts of the military and revolutionary paramilitaries to force the Ayatollah from power, and when Khomeini’s supporters occupied the US embassy in Tehran, he successfully negotiated the release of their hostages. His diplomatic skills became respected even in the West, and he remained in his position until the death of Bazargan in 1995, when he himself became prime minister. Though widely acclaimed for his role in the resistance against the Shah, Yazdi has also been criticized as one of the leaders of the violence against supporters of both the monarchy and the Ayatollah during the revolution. In recent times he has also been accused of authoritarianism, due to his support of the National Pact, signed in 1980 with the Tudeh Party, which has kept the National Front in power, and Iran inside the Soviet sphere for thirty years."
POLITICS_SALEH_ERSHEIDATT_DESC:0 "As Jordan and the Middle East experienced wars, upheaval and revolutions, Saleh Ersheidatt has moved from being a passive observer of change to an active participant in it. Born into a politically connected family in the city of Irbid in 1946, Ersheidatt passed on an immediate political career and instead opted to study civil engineering abroad, first in Egypt and then in West Germany. From the comfort of Europe, he sat out the revolution that toppled the Hashemite monarchy in 1969 and the founding of the Confederation of Palestine in 1979. Upon returning to Jordan the following decade, he held a wide variety of academic, corporate and even diplomatic positions before finally entering politics in response to the 1990 Jordanian Revolution that brought about Jordan’s abortive one-year membership in the Federation of Arab Republics. After a brief legislative stint, Erssheidatt then held successive ministerial posts tasked with managing water treatment and irrigation, public transportation, sports, youth culture and tourism before segueing into the position of Secretary General of the National Current Party and eventually securing the Jordanian presidency in 2007. Despite souring relations with their northern and eastern neighbors over Palestine, Erssheidatt’s presidency still finds Jordan in a very good position, boasting both political freedom and economic stability, a status quo he would like to maintain."
POLITICS_SULTAN_BIN_ABDULAZIZ_AL_SAUD_DESC:0 "King Sultan bin Abdulaziz, or Sultan ‘the Good’ as he is known in Saudi Arabia, is the 15th son of Ibn Saud. He is the second of the Sudairi Seven, an alliance of princes by Ibn Saud’s eighth wife, Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. Together with his six brothers, he rose to prominence under Prince Faisal, being appointed minister of defence in 1963. As the longest serving defence minister in Saudi history, Sultan would fundamentally shape the kingdom’s foreign policy for the next fifty years. His involvement in Yemen and a close call with an Egyptian assassin would deepen the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic, even as King Faisal attempted to mend their relations. With the death of Crown Prince Khalid in 1982, his brother Fahd, the oldest of the Sudairi Seven, succeeded him as second-in-line to the throne. Despite opposition from older princes who sought the position, Sultan was made deputy prime minister and, in time, regent. As King Faisal died in 1991 and the new King Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke in 1995, Sultan became the de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. He soon sought the reversal of many of King Faisal’s liberal reforms, ending detente with the UAR, propping up the conservative government in Yemen and opening up new lines of conflict with the Soviet Union. Saudi oil became the lifesource of Sultan’s foreign fighters and generous charity, earning him his nickname ‘the Good’ with his ascension to the throne in 2005. But now the aging king finds himself in the same seat as many of his brothers, with declining health and the vultures of the Saudi family ready to jump on him at any moment."
POLITICS_NAJEEB_AMADO_DESC:0 "Revolution, whether it be bloody or peaceful, has always been present in the life of Najeeb Amado. Born in Asuncion during the turbulent sixties, a young Najeeb witnessed the violent collapse of the brutal regime of Alfredo Stroessner, even almost losing his life to a grenade during the vicious urban fighting that plagued the capital. After the revolution, Amado joined the United Socialist Party in his twenties, being loyal to party structure and rising through the ranks in Julio Rojas' administration, where he painted himself as a moderate. Amado’s loyalty paid off when he was appointed interior minister in 1983 by the new president, the reformist Ananías Maidana Palacios. There, he used his influence to mediate disputes between the remaining landowners and the indigenous Guarani people, as well as facilitate Ananías' legalization of opposition parties, the modernization of the electoral process and the introduction of multi-party regional elections. When Palacios' health began to decline in 2006, Amado seized the opportunity and, rallying support from the Paraguayan congress, solidified control the following year. He now guides Paraguay on a clear path towards democracy. But with the first free election in the country's history just over the horizon, opponents from both the left and right are rallying support across the nation, and the ultimate fate of Paraguay seems increasingly outside of Amado's hands."
POLITICS_KEIKO_FUJIMORI_DESC:0 "Keiko Fujimori is the oldest child of Alberto Fujimori, a teacher and TV-host who rose to become President of Peru in 1990, during the fallout from the collapse of the United States. She was only 17 years old when her father led a self-coup against the government, forcibly dissolving congress and assuming emergency powers. The country was economically devasted and plagued by terrorism, and Keiko was sent to study in Japan as her father began a brutal war against communist guerillas. The violence of the conflict shocked Keiko’s mother, Susana Higuchi, who split from his father after publicly condemning him. Keiko returned home and was appointed First Lady of Peru in her mother’s place, becoming the youngest in the history of South America. She took an active role in the politics of the country, becoming increasingly influential after her father’s unprecedented third election victory in 2000, often appearing alongside him in official capacity. Her status as successor was confirmed in 2005, when she was chosen as her father’s running mate. At this point opposition to Fujimori’s rule had been virtually stamped out and the two were elected in a landslide, though with much less enthusiasm than expected. In truth, resistance has been growing outside of Fujimori’s puppet parliament. Support for guerillas swelled in rural areas and public protests became increasingly common. Her father soon chose to step down, citing ill health, and was succeeded by Keiko, though this only served to exacerbate the situation. Now, with hundreds joining the resistance by the day, the legacy of Fujimori rests on the edge of a knife."
POLITICS_MAUD_OLOFSSON_DESC:0 "Maud Olofsson has the honor of being one of the few non-Socialist leaders of Europe. Having been active in the Centre Party since 1974, Olofsson climbed the party ladder from Ombudsman of the Norrbotten youth chapter of the Centre Party to the leadership, only making a sojourn from 1981 to 1989 to be a stay-at-home mom. Taking up a career in public administration, she eventually combined her political aspirations with her work experience and was elected to the Riksdag in 2002, making her yet another feature of the changing political landscape that defined the 2000s in Sweden. When Lennart Daléus stepped down from the leadership position in the prelude to the 2006 election, Olofsson was, despite her relatively short tenure in the Riksdag, elected the next leader for the Center Party and led the party to victory in the elections. She formed a coalition with the Christian Democrats, but also with a surprising supply and confidence deal with another newcomer to Swedish politics, Jimmie Åkesson's National Democrats. Olofsson's leadership has brought a new line to the Centre Party, taking it from its agrarian roots in a new direction, as her government has enacted sweeping a liberalization programme of the Swedish economy, with hints of a desire to 'restructure' the Swedish Model. While the left surged in 2009 in response to this, Olofsson managed to maintain a governing majority, in part thanks to the alliance with the National Democrats. Despite their electoral successes, the left-wing of the Centre Party is getting increasingly concerned about her market reforms and the influence of the National Democrats over the government, prompting concerns that the cordon sanitaire against the far left might soon be broken."
POLITICS_JUKA_PEKKA_VAISANEN:0 "The leader of one of the world’s few socialist democracies, Juha-Pekka Väisänen was once a radical adherent of revolutionary communism. As a young man, not yet deeply involved in politics, he was one of the few Finns who supported the attempted takeover of the Finnish government by Moscow-aligned communists in 1983. The aftermath of the coup attempt would see Finland turn against the Soviet Union for the first time in 40 years, and Väisänen’s small-time activism was pushed underground. His second political awakening would be seven years later in 1990, only a year after he graduated, as the escalating tensions between Finland and the USSR led to a border conflict that left dozens dead. The border clashes revealed their true motives, and Väisänen left his previous associations to join the increasingly anti-Soviet Communist Party of Finland. Though principally an artist by trade, he became more and more involved in the international peace movement, leading the ‘artists for peace’ against the wars in Afghanistan and Yemen. He was elected to the parliament, joined the central committee of the SKP and became minister of education and culture in 2007. Only a year later he became chairman of the SKP and prime minister, replacing Asko Mäki who resigned after revelations about his contacts with the KGB. Väisänen’s election campaign, based on the reaffirmation of the party’s anti-Soviet line, was widely accepted within the Finnish political sphere. Despite this he continues to face opposition from the very group of hardline communists he once considered himself a supporter of."
POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_NAJIBULLAH_DESC:0 "Twice imprisoned and twice exiled, Mohammad Najibullah’s journey to become President of Afghanistan has been long and winding. An early member of the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan, Najibullah served as the bodyguard of Babrak Karmal, the leader of the party’s moderate Parcham faction, before the Saur Revolution in 1978. When the PDPA seized power Najibullah became a member of the Revolutionary Council, but his time in the government would be short-lived. The rival Khalq faction soon forced him into exile, only for him to return a year later with the intervening Soviet forces. Karmal was made president and Najibullah became head of the State Intelligence Agency. He soon turned the KHAD into one of the most efficient agencies in Afghanistan, persecuting thousands of subversives as the Soviet forces slowly defeated the Mujahideen fighters across the country. The war was over by 1990 and Najibullah turned his attention to the issue of succession. A power struggle within the party once again led to the ascendancy of the Khalqists, and Najibullah was stripped of his powers and once again sent into exile in 1997. He spent nearly a decade in Moscow before the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan once again triggered a Soviet intervention, this time led by Marshal Leonid Khabarov. The Soviet Army and the KGB united behind Najibullah, who was installed as General Secretary in 2006. Although pursuing a policy of reform and ‘national reconciliation’, there is doubt whether Najibullah’s government will be able to survive without Soviet backing, and whether the USSR will be willing and able to continue their support of the Afghan socialist regime."
POLITICS_KORN_DABBARANSI_DESC:0 "A member of the powerful interest group known as the ‘Rajakru Clan’, Korn Dabbaransi began his political career in 1974 as part of the Thai Nation Party led by his uncle General Chatichai Choonhavan. He served as secretary to General Choonhavan in 1991 while his uncle was prime minister, before being dismissed after a rival military faction seized power. This military junta, led by General Suchinda Kraprayoon, became despised after the army opened fire on unarmed protestors, forcing the King to intervene. Witnessing the collapse of the military regime, Dabbaransi and Choonhavan left the pro-military TNP and founded the National Development Party, returning to power as ‘reformed democrats’ after the election of 1992. Together they oversaw a period of rising prosperity in Thailand, as the economy was reconfigured towards the country’s Asian neighbors and a new, more democratic constitution was promulgated. Dabbaransi became the leader of the NDP in 1998 after the death of Choonhavan and rose to become prime minister after pushing out his uncle’s successor, General Arthit Kamlang-ek, later that same year. Faced with popular discontent due to corruption and nepotism during the Rajakru rule, Dabbaransi was voted out in 2000, only to return three years later after his rivals in the TNP collapsed over the same issue. Dabbaransi’s second premiership has defined his controversial decision to legalize the Communist Party of Thailand as part of his effort to move closer to China. This has been widely scrutinized by the country’s military establishment, who monitor his administration for any justification to seize power once again."
POLITICS_MAHMUD_ALI_DURRANI_DESC:0 "A veteran of two Indo-Pakistani wars, Mahmud Ali Durrani rose to prominence as the secretary of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who seized power in 1978 and executed Pakistan’s previous socialist leader, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Eventually being promoted to commander of the 1st Armoured Division, Durrani was one of the main suspects in the 1988 plane crash that killed his commander-in-chief, although he was never tried for the incident. Distrusted by the military establishment, he was relegated to small-time posts far from the military halls of power. That changed in 1990 as the military was unable to prevent the incursion of the Soviet Air Forces into Pakistani territory, bombing several Mujahideen training camps and causing an international crisis. With the military widely discredited, Durrani was appointed Chief of Army Staff by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Tasked with reforming the army command in order to prevent any further violations of Pakistani sovereignty, Durrani promoted a cadre of young officers to leadership positions while implementing new doctrines of warfare. In 1997 he too launched a coup d’état against the increasingly unpopular socialist government. He soon cemented power as a new military president, appointing a civilian prime minister while maintaining actual power around himself. The country stabilized over the following years as Durrani presided over a growing economy and increasingly normalized relations with Pakistan’s traditional rival, India. But the acclaimed ‘General of Peace’ still faces domestic opposition and increasing pressure from the international community over Pakistan’s continued support for rebel groups in Afghanistan."
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_QAHTAN_DESC:0 "Mohammed Qahtan rose to prominence in 1990 after joining a young Al-Islah and becoming an important anti-YSP activist, and when the civil war broke out in Yemen, he served as a member of the opposition against the General People's Congress. It was in that position that Qahtan vocalized his desire for unity against the southern socialists. After Ali Abdullah Saleh and his successor Mohammed Abdullah Saleh died, Qahtan found himself the foreign minister of a new government. There he guaranteed Saudi and American support for the north, and further legitimized Al-Islah over the GPC internationally. When the civil war came to an end, Qahtan played a key role in drafting what would become the new Yemeni constitution. A year later in 2005, to guarantee Saudi Arabian and American support, he was nominated for president. Qahtan promised stability for Yemen and an end to the socialists that continued to resist northern rule. However, with a stagnating economy, blatant government corruption and unsatisfactory civil liberties, the people of Yemen have grown hostile to Mohammed Qahtan's government. With a recent resurgence in Southern rebel attacks, the continued rise of Ahmed Saleh and the GPC and increased demand for democratic reform, discontent with the Al-Islah government is now at an all-time high, and Qahtan will do anything to maintain his position as president and stability for Yemen."
POLITICS_JUAN_CARLOS_DESC:0 "King Juan Carlos I has ruled as the sovereign king of Spain since the death of Caudillo Francisco Franco in 1975, having been groomed for leadership by the dictator since his youth. The King’s education was largely entrusted to Fernández Miranda, who served as head of government following the assassination of Franco’s right hand man, Luis Carrero Blanco. Miranda guided the King in a more liberal direction, and, shortly after Juan Carlos began his reign, attempts were made to begin a transition to democracy, with both the People’s Alliance and the Socialist Workers’ Party being formally recognized by the state. However, this transition was not meant to be. In 1976, it was revealed that the United States government had been considering invading Spain to prevent a socialist party from winning the imminent elections. This crisis drove Juan Carlos to invoke his emergency powers, dissolving parliament and taking absolute power for himself. While the Francoist constitution remains, Juan Carlos has purged the FET y de las JONS, opting instead to mold the People’s Party into his own loyalist organization. It is from the ranks of the People’s Party and the military that Juan Carlos has selected the bulk of his appointed officials. While Juan Carlos’ leadership has kept the country afloat, it remains plagued by overbearing military political influence, regionalist divides, a crumbling economy, and other ailments. The King’s advanced age has sparked concern over his son’s ability to meet these challenges, and many worry that Spain will not survive without his firm guidance."
POLITICS_SADDAM_HUSSEIN_DESC:0 "Saddam Hussein was one of the earliest members of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party. He became infamous for leading the failed attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, the military strongman who had seized power from the monarchy in 1958. This forced Saddam into exile in Syria, where he developed close ties to the Syrian Ba’ath. Upon his return to Iraq, Syrian support helped him rise to the Regional Command of the party, but Saddam soon broke all ties with them after the marxist takeover of the Syrian party in 1965. This permanently split the Ba’ath Party into Syrian and Iraqi factions. Two years later the party led a bloodless coup against the Nasserist government, with Saddam heading the post-coup purge which established the Iraqi Ba’ath Party as the most powerful faction in the country. For a decade he served as second-in-command to his cousin, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, gaining a reputation as an effective politician. To maintain power in the deeply sectarian country, he ensured loyalty through a combination of economic modernization, welfare spending and the creation of a ruthless security apparatus. Gradually his power came to outshine even his cousin, with many successful policies such as the occupation of Kuwait in 1978 being attributed to him rather than the president. He eventually forced al-Bakr out of office in 1979 to take up the mantle himself. Saddam Hussein has succeeded in building one of the richest countries in the Arab world. But this wealth stands upon a corrupt structure of cronyism and an increasing reliance on oil, a capricious resource which might unravel the entire system."
POLITICS_JOAQUIM_CHISSANO_DESC:0 "Joaquim Chissano is one of the founding members of the Liberation Front of Mozambique, the movement that led the Mozambican War of Independence against Portugal. Chissano played a pivotal role in this conflict, fighting on the ground, but also negotiating the Lusaka Accord which paved the way for Mozambique’s independence in 1975. Chissano would serve as the country’s first foreign minister under President Samora Machel, the leader of FRELIMO. But the young nation soon fell into civil war, with the newly-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist government being opposed by rebels funded by Rhodesia and South Africa. Even as their backers fell one by one, the rebels could not be stamped out, and the president’s hardline stance became more and more untenable. As the civil war continued, President Machel stepped down as leader of FRELIMO in 1995 in favor of Chissano, though the so-called ‘moderate Marxist’ initially maintained his stance against the rebels. Peace negotiations could truly begin in 1996, as President Chissano pushed through a new constitution guaranteeing multi-party democratic elections. The final peace agreement was signed in 1999 in Toledo between FRELIMO and the rebel group RENAMO, with mediation from the Papacy. In the next year’s elections the voters overwhelmingly supported Chissano, giving him a truly democratic mandate. His presidency has been defined by a strong advocacy for national reconciliation. To secure this peace he has promoted transcendental meditation for all members of the government and military, while guaranteeing key positions to members of former rebel groups. Chissano has become a shining example of democratic leadership in a continent dominated by despots, and many speculate if anyone can stand up to the task of being his successor."
POLITICS_BASHAR_AL_ASSAD_DESC:0 "Bashar al-Assad is the scion of the powerful al-Assad family, who have controlled the Syrian regional presidency of the United Arab Republic since 1971. His father was Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite military officer who helped found the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party. Hafez played a crucial role in ensuring the unity of the UAR when he deposed the marxist Salah Jadid in 1970, and integrated the Ba'ath Party into the ruling Arab Socialist Union. Hafez would remain regional president for 29 years, a time which Bashar spent far from the halls of power. Quiet, reserved and lacking any interest in politics or the military, Bashar pursued a career in medicine after graduating from the University of Damascus, settling in London. He returned only after the death of his father in 2000, as his brother Bassel assumed the regional presidency. Bassel reversed many of his father’s moderate policies, deepening the Assad family’s ties with the Soviet Union and pushing Cairo to take a hard line against the Confederation of Palestine. Bashar would support his brother loyally, but only assumed a minor government position as head of the Syrian Computer Society. Many doubted whether Bashar was truly being groomed as a potential successor to his brother, lacking any military experience or support among the armed forces, but after the assassination of Bassel the Syrian Regional Assembly overwhelmingly supported him. After tensions with Cairo escalated to the breaking point, Bashar reorganized his father’s Ba’ath Party and led Syria to secede from the UAR. Now he must secure not only his country’s independence, but also his own power from the numerous factions, cliques and movements that oppose him."
