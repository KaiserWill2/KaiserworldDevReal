 ### GENERIC TREE
army_effort:0 "The Armed Forces"
army_effort_desc:0 "The army is the oldest and most needed form of military in todays day and age. A motherland needs its sons and daughters as much as it needs its food or air. And as technology advances, we need to help improve our armed forces, and make sure we beat time rather than fall behind it."
equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernization"
equipment_effort_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with. And though we will give something for them to fight with, we cant let it be stick vs sword with the odds in the enemy favor. So it seems like time to have an upgrade and finally have an update as we follow time with its endless progression."
motorization_effort:0 "Motorized Men"
motorization_effort_desc:0 "Our infantry is still human, and with heavy equipment and them often having to walk many kilometers on end at one point, it can drain our troop strength and eventually leave them exausted in battle. So lets make it easier for them, Lets move them in motorized vehichles! While this isn't rocket technology knowing it has been tried and used much before, we should still expand upon this technology as it is very useful."
doctrine_effort:0 "Doctrines of War"
doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Doctrines can be very useful in war as they decide how we fight. We should work on a sort of doctrine expansion and organization program which can help us come up with new ways of fighting while expanding upon the old ones."

equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with. And though we will give something for them to fight with, we cant let it be stick vs sword with the odds in the enemy favor.

mechanization_effort:0 "Mechs!"
mechanization_effort_desc:0 "While not actual Mech robots, sorry if I got your hopes up, actually im not. But back to the topic, mechanized vehichles can be used like motorized vehichles would, moving our troops faster and easier while keeping them ready for the fight. Pretty neat huh?"
doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrines of War II"
doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Doctrines can be very useful in war as they decide how we fight. We should work on a sort of doctrine expansion and organization program which can help us come up with new ways of fighting while expanding upon the old ones.

equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Modernization"
equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with.

fighter_focus_desc:0 "The Fighters in the sky are those to hold the place they fight in. Without fighters we are unable to destroy the enemy air force and in the process lose the skies. So lets ramp up productions on these planes! Let us defend the skies in our favor!"
bomber_focus:0 "Bombers"
bomber_focus_desc:0 "Bombers are a great unit in the air, they are used for destroying cities, infastructure, or anything on the ground!

aviation_effort_2:0 "The Air Defence"
aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "As much as we need the ground and water, we also need the air.

 USA_cut_military_spending:0 "Pushback Against the Military-Industrial Complex!"
 USA_cut_military_spending_desc:0 "The Progressive ideals that this country was rebuilt and reunified upon have been chipped away and removed for over 50 years.
