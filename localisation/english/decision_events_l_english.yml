 decision_event.1.t:0 "The Dumfries War"
 decision_event.1.d:0 "Prior to the start of the war, the USBR military under the leadership of Chairman Lawrence went through a drastic purge often referred to as “The Great Purge”. This saw generals like Bill Alexander be imprisoned and eventually executed. From here several low-ranking officers were promoted to general. To give these generals experience in combat, Lawrence started to give speeches about unifying the nation under the banner of totalism, and his first target was to be Scotland.\n\nOn July 5th, 1950, USBR soldiers started to amass on the border in Northumbria while several airborne divisions boarded planes. At 12:30 am EST/ 6:30 pm CEST, 6 divisions of airborne infantry landed in Dumfries, Scotland while 12 divisions of mechanized infantry crossed to border. By 12:00 am CEST, Edinburgh came under the control of syndicalist forces. This prompted the government to retreat to Inverness. To combat the spreading of Syndicalism, the UN called on nations to intervene in this conflict. Both Canada and the German Empire were the first to send divisions. For days the Scottish military was beaten back, eventually being relegated to the Hebrides. That did change on August 1st when General Walter Model landed soldiers in Dunbar. From Dunbar, General Model would lead his soldiers towards retaking Edinburgh. They’d surround the city laying siege to it. With American and Canadian reinforcements, the syndicalist forces would be pushed back.\n\nWith the capture of Edinburgh came Russia’s involvement in the war. While no generals were sent, several divisions were placed under the direct control of Chairman Lawrence. These divisions named the “Peoples Volunteers”, would fight in several of the most significant battles more than half would perish in the battle of Oxford.\n\nWhile conflict would continue for another year, an armistice would be signed on October 19th, 1951 members from the Scottish government and members of Lawrence’s cabinet met aboard the German Supercarrier “SMS Siegfried” where the Syndicalists accepted terms of peace. To this day, every chairman has vowed to avenge the wrongs of the war."

Unbeknownst to the French, the German Empire had recently concluded a conference in Munich where it was decided that Wallonia would come under the direct protection of the German government.\n\nAs the first French tank crossed the border into Wallonia, so to did the first German Bomber into French territory. As news of conflict spread, the Internationale would rally to the aid of their French comrades.\n\nChairmans Mousollini and Mosely jointly declared war on the German Empire, and soon enough the rest of the Reichspakt joined their mother country.\n\nConflict would continue along several fronts for nearly a year until the “Disaster on the Isles”. During the collapse of the Mosley regime, many prominent units belonging to the USBR were recalled to the Isles including T.E. Lawrences battalion.\n\nWithin days of this withdrawal. Germans regained all Wallonian territories and started to push into Dunkirk.\n\nMonths later the Italians withdrew from the war due to a coup by the then terror group “Neo-Sandefisti”. To add onto this, the French Empire under the control of Napoleon Bonaparte IV landed in Southern France taking both Marseilles and Nice within hours of each other. In America, the economic center of the West would collapse as the Huey Long government succumbed to internal pressure and eventual collapse."

However, when the Mladrossi military unexpectedly marched into St. Petersburg forcing the far-right government to go into exile, the German military was left in a panic. Within days of their victory in the mainland, the Monarcho-Bolshevist military ripped up the treaty and crossed into Ukrainian territory. Less than a week later, the Ukranian military collapsed and the Monarcho-Bolshevist flag was raised in Kiev.\n\nThe Germans, now faced with a Russian invasion of mainland Prussia divided their forces to stem the Russian hordes advance. In reality this was too late. Units arriving to the front were undersupplied and much of the time they ended up surrendering to the Russians.\n\nWeeks after the arrival of Russian forces, the tide was finally stopped at The Battle of Riga When Herman Hoth outmanuevered the Russians and forced them into a surrender. The advance would effectively be stopped but the Germans would fail almost every counter attack.\n\nThe German machine would be stretched even thinner when the Scottish rebels in the former USBR asked for German Protection. In an agreement reached in Dublin, the fledgling Scottish state would place a German by the name of “Franz von Bayern” on the Scottish throne while Germany would guarantee the Scottish their independence.\n\nThe French government ultimately left to its own devices was facing war on every front. While some Italian divisions still loyal to Chairman Mussolini would fight for the French Totalist state.\n\nAmerica would continue to burn as its second civil war continued to rage on."

This discovery was relayed to much of the Lawrence cabinet with many of them being brought to his estate outside of Oxford. The first to arrive was noted reformist Clement Atlee. Following him was the heir apparent, Anthony Eden who according to records broke down crying near the body of the Chairman Lawrence.\n\nAfter several days of deliberations, the funeral for Chairman Thomas Edward Lawrence was underway in the capitol of London. For the first time in nearly a decade, the civilian population of the country was allowed into the Peoples Palace, alongside the remnant of the Anglican church.\n\nGeneral Percy Hobart, a noted hero of the Lawrence regime and believed to be the sole reason for the survival of the nation led the procession alongside General Mikhail Frunze and Fredrick Browning.\n\nDays later, in a power grab, Anthony Eden bribed General Hobart into assisting with the disposal of the Atlee and his reformist compatriots."

Just 1 year after the first engagement, the Russians would take Rigs with little to no resistance. When they entered the city, the Germans were forced to sign a peacy treaty with the Russian government. Meeting in Kyiv the Russians demanded that all former territories belonging to the old Tsardom be ceded back to the Peoples Tsardom and that the Germans be forced to retreat into Old Prussia. The German government had no choice but to accept this humiliating treaty.\n\nIn response to this humiliation, Reichspresident Kurt von Schleicher announced a state of emergency sidelining the Kaiser and granting him emergency powers. When Von Schleicher attempted to abolish the Monarchy in the middle of the war, elements of the military forcibly removed Von Schleicher from power. The new provisional government appointed Erich Von Manstein as Prime Minister.\n\nMansteins first order was to reassign all available divisions to the Western Front."

In the end, neither side would end up winning and Fiorello La Guardia ended up declaring a free city. SPA militias took much of the country within the first year with Washington and Atlanta falling to their seemingly unstoppable horde.California and much of the West Coast ended up leaving the Union early in the war securing a peace with their neighbors.\n\nOver the months, frontlines turned into stalemates and innovative tactics were forced into use. During the Battle of New Orleans, the Syndicate military used a form of rapid-tank warfare to capture the city. Days later Huey Long and members of his cabinet would arrive in San Francisco pleading for political asylum.\n\nDuring this time, the Pacific States of America was undergoing a political crisis which nearly split the nation in half. During this period, the military took power and less than a week later the Nortonist rebels stormed the capitol taking the city and creating a new Monarchist America. During the first days of Joshua II’s reign, the upstart monarch created a parliament and thus a Prime Ministership for someone to occupy.\n\nIn his ever knowing wisdom, Joshua II selected former United States President Huey Long to be his prime minister. Longs ascension would be welcomed by those new citizens of the Empire. Long alongside the Emperor announced a reclamation campaign.\n\nWithin 3 years, the entirety of the United States was under the control of Nortons Empire, except for New York City, and the New England area."

Goldwater served over a decent economy for his first 2 years but in 1974, a recession would occur which would begin to tank the economy and his popularity. After dealing with dishonest politicians for nearly 35 years, Americans became upset with the system. When outsider Jimmy Carter campaigned on honesty and more transparency with the American public, he was able to gain rising support and was outpolling Goldwater by nearly 30-40% in some polls. The first Prime Ministership debate cemented Carter’s lead with Goldwater’s infamous “There is no Russian domination over Eastern Europe” comment. Jimmy Carter was able to appeal to the American people with his outsider perspective, humbleness, and commitment to openness.\n\nThe 1976 Election would result in Jimmy Carter winning the Prime Ministership with 60% of the popular vote. Jimmy Carter would preside over a recovering and eventually thriving economy throughout his tenure and would be easily re-elected in 1980. Carter’s VP - Walter Mondale, ran for office in 1984 and was elected in a landslide. However, he oversaw a recession from 1986 until 1989 which effectively doomed his prime ministership. George HW Bush was then able to run on a campaign of bringing the nation back to pragmatism and conservatism. He won in 1988, and was able to keep the country relatively well, and eased tensions with foreign nations. However, the economy took an immense hit in 1990 and again led to the rise of other ideologies. Ross Perot, Texas Billionaire and political outsider, was able to gain immense support and easily beat Bush in 1992. Ross Perot would go on to serve two successful terms as Prime Minister and be easily re-elected in 1996.\n\nBy 2000 Jeb Bush won the 2000 Election in a narrow victory of 200 votes in the state of Florida and would go on to begin the Beringian War after the 9/10 Attacks. Although he was re-elected in 2004, public opinion of him would drop dramatically after his failures in Beringia and Great Recession of 2008.

That’s when the leader decided it was time to finally expand the republic and take the Falklands which is what the people of Argentina always felt what was rightfully theirs and how Britain stole it off them hundreds of years ago. Taking back such a prize would give some breathing space to the regime to figure out a way to resolve the economic situation."

Canada was unable to respond to invasion due to the Canadian parliament refusing to involve themselves in a war even with the pleads of Queen Elizabeth, her majesty spoke with King Norton who agreed they cannot allow syndicalism to show signs of expansion and therefore the Empire of America will be the ones who free the people of the Falkland Islands.\n\nThe Empires government quickly assembled a naval task force built around two aircraft carriers and a brand new light carrier as well as two cruise ships who sailed to the islands supplied with thousands of American troops. On May the 2nd the first shots were fired from the Empires navy force, the obsolete Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by an American nuclear-powered submarine. Argentina’s  navy posed no threat to the Empire as its force was small and outdated as well as the republic only focusing on its armed forces."

 decision_event.24.d:0 "Project Delta-001 is the study of the seemingly “altered” version of the founder HP Lovecraft. Describing himself as “the original” Lovecraft he describes his reality as widely different. Earth 001 as he puts it was devoured by the Elder Gods. He through a form of magic has been jumping between realities escaping the grasp of the old one. Initially landing in Providence near the grave of this realities Lovecraft, he was quickly apprehended and brought into the custody of the organization.\n\nLovecraft is cooperative with the organization and has given information of each reality he has visited. Apparently, our version is one of the few Earths to possess a Delta Green organization. After deliberation, Lovecraft himself was instated to the Green Council."

 decision_event.25.d:0 "Discovered in 1962 by Agent Lee Harvey Oswald while visiting a Pizza Shop in Lower Manhattan. The “Pizza Pie” consists of 8 metallic triangles of a still unknown composition. They pose no threat unless specifically activated. Agent Oswald on November 22nd, 1963 accidentally activated the Pie when discussing a rivalry with an old military buddy named John F Kennedy. His location is currently unknown.\n\nIt is believed that the Pie or pieces of the Pie when connected can transport an individual or group back in time or into a completely different reality. Similar metals have been found in Project 002.\n\nDr. William Lazar believes that the Pizza Pie is not exactly in our reality but instead is in every reality while not being in any reality. He among others believes that the Pie, while suicidal can be used to travel forward or backward in time to correct the mistakes of our current selves.  Although it would be hard to prove the concept of time travel, let alone interdimensional travel."

 decision_event.26.d:0 "Bob is a normal, non-eldritch 40-year-old man. He believes he lives in the town of Blackport, Maine. All civilians presents are Delta Green personnel in disguise with a healthy mix of brainwashed prisoners. Bob comes with certain rules.\n\n1.Bob can not be fed any fish. If he consumes any form of seafood the town is to be evacuated and Agents are to be sent in to tranquilize Bob\n\n2.Bob can not be exposed to pornography of any kind.\n\n3.Bob can not be exposed to the CNN network\n\n4.Bob is to believe that the current year is 1984. All technology around the town is to be from the time period.\n\n5.Bob cannot know about rap music. If he hears any form of rap..run.\n\nBob may look normal, but he is not. The man is a portal between the nether and reality itself. When consuming fish or seafood he has collapsed while the tentacle of Cthulhu reaches into our universe. Pornography evokes the words of Azazoth, and CNN as discovered recently will cause his body to be possessed by demons. Discovered in 1984, he was a man being arrested for the murder of his parents, neighbors, and several police officers. His portal powers were discovered when apprehended into custody.\n\nTo maintain a sense of normalcy, Bob was placed into a quarantine zone mimicking his old life. Convinced he is still living in 1984, Bob has not had an incident in years. Research is currently looking into how he can be killed and the threat lifted."

 decision_event.27.d:0 "“Chairman Blairs Newspaper” as it has been nicknamed is a copy of “The Daily Sun”. Found in the USBR by an embedded agent codenamed “Fawkes”, the newspaper possesses no such paranormal properties.Anthony Blair as we can ascertain is the leader of a “social democratic” party in the UK, much akin to the American “Commonwealth” party. Little can be ascertained about why this newspaper appeared in the Stonehenge area with many in the upper leadership believing Stonehenge to be an earlier “prototype” for what the “Ohio Pillar” would later become.Preliminary research has revealed that no form of “The Guardian” or “The Sun” exist in any nation on this planet.\n\nFew things can be ascertained about this said timeline, “TL-1997”. Researchers, with the little information they have believe this timeline to be spawned out of a difference sometime during or after the First Weltkrieg with the front page talking about the 1997 UK election and the election of the defunct ‘Labour Party’. After reading and close analysis we can say that this Anthony Blair, or “Tony” for short as the paper calls him and seems to be a devoted social democrat and embraces democracy."
