 England.1.t:0 "Welcome To The Union"
 England.1.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 England.4.t:0 "The Legacy Of Michael Foot"
 England.4.d:0 "Michael foot passed away leaving his deputy, Tony Blair to take charge. Blair, a military man, quickly rose through the ranks of the USBR military to Commanding General of the armed forces.

 England.4.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 England.5.t:0 "Blairs Iron Fist"
 England.5.d:0 "Chairman Blair has sentenced many traitorous generals to death for their crimes against the eternal revolution. With this, many close family members have been placed under watch and some have been confined to their homes as he reforms the nation into something new. Not everyone can be trusted, as even Blair himself has come under the scrutiny of assassination attempts. Praise Blair for his reforms."
 England.5.o1:0 "Blair Strikes At His Own"
 England.6.t:0 "Blairs Weapon Research Order"
 England.6.d:0 "General Blair has ordered many of the USBR’s top scientists to focus more on the development of nuclear weapons than the needs of the people. Blairs logic is that once the USBR has the capability to launch nuclear missiles and liberate the rest of the world from the tyranny of monarchism, then the peoples needs will be met. For now they will have to sacrifice just that that bit for the nation."
 England.6.o1:0 "The Union Moves Forward"
 England.7.t:0 "The Weapon Parade"
 England.7.d:0 "In T.E. Lawrence Square, rockets, tanks, soldiers, and even jets march to show that the hermit state is ready and willing to defend itself.

 England.8.t:0 "We Love Blair!"
 England.8.d:0 "The people of the USBR must swear their total loyalty to the great leader, those who stand against him are traitors and will be punished.

 England.9.t:0 "The General's TV Broadcast"
 England.9.d:0 "General Blair has appeared on state television announcing the union is finally at a point where it is now able to defend itself against its enemies and is equipped for a modern age.

 England.9.o1:0 "General Blair Defends His People!"
 England.10.t:0 "The Union Economy Plan"
 England.10.d:0 "The unions economy has always needed support from other far left nations, although the nations have a surplus of oil thanks to the North Sea, many democratic nations refuse to trade with the union causing the economy to slump. Now is the time to finally fix the money problems and expand its friendships with other like-minded leaders."
 England.10.o1:0 "The Peoples Economy Will Be Rebuilt!"
 England.11.t:0 "The Korean Friendship"
 England.11.d:0 "England and Korea do not have the best of relations, but it is our duty to reach out to other totalist allies.

The two countries will now begin to trade industrial goods, weapons, food products, and even military intelligence."
 England.11.o1:0 "Juché And Totalism United"
 England.12.t:0 "The Russian Summit"
 England.12.d:0 "Blair has met with the Russian leader and came to a new trade agreement between the nations, with strong investment from Russia and free open trade between the nations to increase products and strength the economies.

 England.12.o1:0 "Russia And England United"
 England.13.t:0 "The Scottish And Welsh Situation"
 England.13.d:0 "Under the rule of Oswald Mosley, our great nation collapsed into anarchy and we lost two important areas. Scotland and Wales. Our nation seeks to reunite with our brothers and sisters, whether its through force or whether its through peace is up to the parties involved. Either way"
 England.13.o1:0 "Uniting Our Lands"
 England.14.t:0 "Securing Our Lands"

 England.16.t:0 "The Voice For Unification"
 England.16.d:0 "Scotland and England both wish for reunification but unification for these nations are under very different ideas, Scotland wishes to extend their monarchs power while Blair aims to liberate the proletariat under totalism.

 England.16.o1:0 "Planning Our Final Victory"
 England.17.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.17.d:0 "The annual Congress of the USBR has finally arrived and this year its going to be a big one, many from overseas speculate with the new changes going on in the isle General Blair will outline his plans for army reforms as well as his plans to take Wales and Scotland, rather than focusing on the huge poverty and huge crimes against humanity against his own people."
 England.17.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.18.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.18.d:0 "Scotland has recently been hacking into the State Media service and spreading their Pro-Monarchist, Pro- “Freedom” messages to all corners of our nation. They encourage our citizens to leave the nation and flee to Wales or cross the DMZ to Scotland. Our citizens know better than that, and we shall swiftly punish the Scottish for this foolhardy attempt at destabilizing our nation."
 England.18.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.19.t:0 "The Oil Dispute"
 England.19.d:0 "Scotland has ordered warships to meet with our union navy in the North Sea, while our expansion over the oil has been criticised by the Scottish its seems they will not allow us to go quietly. It seems we both are waiting for each of us to fire the first shot. Unfortunately for the Scottish we will never back down from OUR own waters. The oil is ours and will be used to fuel our tanks while we crush the Celtic bastards."
 England.19.o1:0 "Our Water Machines Will Crush The Scots"
 England.20.t:0 "Come On Wales, Dont Be Silly"
 England.20.d:0 "It seems a war with Wales could be pointless, due to our armies massively outnumbering theirs and our armed forces total loyalty. Rather if we are able to spread our ideology over the state sooner or later they will be joining us and begging for our dear leader to take their state into the USBR."
 England.20.o1:0 "They Have No Choice"
 England.21.t:0 "Cornwall Resistance"
 England.21.d:0 "It seems that our attention to Cornwall has fallen on unwelcome ears. It seems the Cornish wish for an independent state?

 England.21.o1:0 "Freedom Is Slavery"
 England.22.t:0 "Congress Branches"

 England.23.t:0 "End Of The Congress"
 England.23.d:0 "The laws and reforms have finally finished. The congress has ended the yearly meeting by singing the national anthem “the red flag”. General Blair ended saying this year will be the biggest year of the USBR and change will come to each of our comrades."
 England.23.o1:0 "Time For Celebrations"
 England.24.t:0 "The Union Army"
 England.24.d:0 "General Blair has ordered the complete reconstruction of the Grand Union Army. He has ordered every man and woman to stand with the armed forces and fight for their great and honourable leaders.

 England.24.o1:0 "The Union Will Be Defended!"
 England.25.t:0 "Defending The Union"
 England.25.d:0 "England is surrounded by enemies. Even those who call themselves our allies can not truly be trusted.

 England.26.o1:0 "Thank Our Young Soldiers"
 England.27.t:0 "Remembering Canada"
 England.27.d:0 "Canada is still a black spot in our history. They still claim the mantle of the true English, they bow down to the tyrannical royals and many capitalist enemies of our past still survive in Ottowa. We have engrained in our society the terrors if what happened when Canada failed to reach our shores, and by Blair we’ll make sure it never happens again."

 England.32.t:0 "Drills Of Lindisfarne"
 England.32.d:0 "Lindisfarne is a historical site where the Vikings first landed in Britain and raided the historical monastery of Lindisfarne.

 England.35.t:0 "The Real Union Education"
 England.35.d:0 "The children of Brittania are taught to embrace totalism and it’s values. However, this is not enough. Starting today, from year 1 all the way to year 12, kids will be encouraged to be apart of the Eternal revolution.

 England.41.o1:0 "This Is Pointless"
 England.42.t:0 "The Talks Fail"
 England.42.d:0 "The Welsh Leaders have asked to sit down with us and try to find a diplomatic way to resolve this matter. It seems they are scared and wish to prevent war and invasion. Unfortunately, they wish for us to stay away from Wales. That isn’t an option.\n\nTHE LEADERS WILL NOT LEAVE US ALONE! THEY BEG AND PLEAD, “THINK OF THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT COULD BE LOST”. We just looked and shook our heads, its obvious they are weak and need to adapt to a new totalist life. Its decided, Wales will be ours and we will train the Welsh people to no longer fear death. "

 England.272.t:0 "Take The Dragons Head"
 England.272.d:0 "General Blair has given the thumbs up, its war. After nearly 70 years of peace, the union has finally reached a point where it is now ready to shed blood again. The army has begun to walk through the hills of the English border and fired at the border walls on the Welsh side. As guard towers collapsed and the Welsh soldiers tried to fire at us, it seemed that already the war was turning against them. Our soldiers opened fire as union fighter jets roared over the skies of Wales."
 England.272.o1:0 "Its Time To Unite The Union."
 England.273.t:0 "Wales Has Fallen"
 England.273.d:0 "The war as predicated was short and a strong easy win. Once we marched into the city of Cardiff the Welsh Ministry started peace talks and finally agreed a transfer of power. The Welsh State will for now become a temporary transitional state until we have rebuilt the state and we are ready to bring the state of Wales under the totalist banner. Some rebel groups have tried to fight back but their fighting as been put down quick. General Blair has been heard to have celebrated by asking for some Welsh people to be brought to his palace and shot at while he watches and drinks with his generals."
 England.273.o1:0 "We Finally Take The Dragon."
 England.45.t:0 "Down Goes The Flag"
 England.45.d:0 "The red dragon and the Welsh flag will now be icons of an illegal protest and anyone who waves those will be arrested.

 England.46.t:0 "The Trials Of Wales"
 England.46.d:0 "Blair promised no harm would come to the Welsh politicians and would have free passage to leave for Ireland. As they waited at Swansea harbour about to bord a passenger ship, union agents came and quickly arrested them, the leaders shouting their demands as they were told they were allowed to be freed! Once captured they were taken away to London, not long after staged trails had taken place. Each leader admitted their crimes against the USBR and begged for forgiveness. Within minutes the jury had decided their fate, each one was to be founded guilty with either the option of being hung by the neck or shot by firing squad."

 England.47.o1:0 "The End Of Wales"
 England.48.t:0 "The Great Defeat"
 England.48.d:0 "It seems the Welsh were bluffing when they asked us to stop. Once our soldiers crossed into the borders of Wales they were gunned down instantly, the training given to our men and woman had failed as they were completely unprepared. Jets were easily shot out the sky, only weapons from Canada and the US could have done this, it seems the dirty capitalists had been working the whole time with the Welsh and were preparing them for years for this moment. Blair has ordered any man, woman or child who has fled from the battlefield to be shot in the streets and be shown as a moment that the U.S.B.R will never forget!"

 England.49.t:0 "Kill The Runners"

 England.50.o1:0 "Damn The Welsh!"
 England.51.t:0 "The Wrath Of General Blair"
 England.51.d:0 "Comrade Blair, the man who promised a return to English glory and supremacy has become the laughing stock of the world. To combat this, General Blair has ordered “Unspecified searches” of homes suspected of dissidents. If they were found to be watching international broadcasts, or reading prohibited books, or even listening to any music that’s not approved by the ministry of culture, then these families were deported off to work camps or shot in the streets."

 England.52.d:0 "General Blair has visited the border of Wales to see exactly what caused the defeat of the army and where it went wrong as well as how they could of overcome the imperialists weaponry being fired upon them. Once he reached the guard tower on the English side he turned to his second in Command, Dermot Hudson who heard a loud bang. Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests. Blair was airlifted to a hospital close by but once there no matter what the doctors did, it was too late, General Blair was dead."

At 0:800 yesterday our great leader General-Chairman Anthony Blair was assassinated by a cowardly Welshman. As the General met with our soldiers on the eve of our invasion, he was shot in the chest from a long-range rifle. His last words were “Do not let the Union fall”. In his last moments, our compassionate leader had only thought about the nation.”\n\nNews of the assassination took days to reach the rest of the world, but across Canada, the American Empire, Scotland, Germany, and even India, celebrations broke out.

Rain fell hard on the streets, to the point that those religious few left in the USBR said “Even God weeps for the fallen General”. His car would proceed to Manchester an hour later, the whole time being followed by a caravan of military and citizen mourners.

He spoke about how such a situation could have been allowed to happen and why it was never investigated or even picked up by security forces, he then moved on saying that what has been discovered is the totalist and syndicalists planned this trying to put the blame on the ENP to take back control of the republic.

As the night went on after the voting, more and more of the left and liberal seats fell to the ENP wiping out any chance of forming a strong opposition.

We used to call it the Plough but you know…..the Foot years and the renaming. Well, you’ll find it no less.” The captain said.\n\nDiana donned a worker’s outfit and went into the fray. Less than an hour later, the former princess found herself in front of a run down wooden building. “Victory Pub#1681” the sign read. “How dreadfully creative” she thought to herself.\n\nWhen walking inside, a knife was put to her throat and the voice of a cockney Englishman asked “You a fucking police?” She panicked a bit and said “No why would you think that?”\n\n“Well miss…you’re too pretty to be from around these parts. So either you’re a secret police here to shut down the bar, or you’re a foreigner. So which is it?”\n\n“Foreigner!” She yelled out. This blew her cover and she knew it.\n\n“Alright….you may be the one we’ve expected.

Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests.

And it was possible to put a roll of cloth into the machine as a whole, thus it could save cloth by 20% while further increasing productivity.\n\nAfter hearing an official's explanation he wore a bright smile on his face, saying that it is good to make things by themselves, and that self-reliance is the only way out.\n\nHe expressed his great satisfaction that it was good to have made the barotor machine with their own efforts and technology by dint of self-reliance.\n\n– The Star Newspaper"

Thanks to the anti-missile weapons given by the Empire of America, the Scottish army shot down all the missiles flying overhead and successfully prevented any attacks on Scottish territory.\n\nAn enraged Tony Blair has forced Scotland to give up their weapons or face serious consequences which in return, Francis fired back at the comments saying Blair was scared and he has finally met his match. “No more shall Scotland stand by and allow their lands to be abused, from this moment forward Scotland shall fire back and if anymore weapons are testing in or around the Kingdom, England shall be the next target practice.” No further comments have been made yet by the U.S.B.R."

Something that was eventually accepted introducing another annexed state by the Empire corning the U.S.B.R in all directions."

The union must give up their progress on building nuclear weaponry and stop all weapon testing. If this aggression continues, then the Empire will have no choice but to intervene.

Much fighting has taken place there with the Military unable to take control of the city and towns fighting back. As the fighting got fiercer and the people of the North turn against the government the army returned back into the south acknowledging the North has been lost to the far left ideology.\n\nAs the military left and crossed the newly created border, the IRSM announced that they have now taken away the republican dictatorship and now a new Ireland has risen from the ashes that will finally be free. The leaders of the far-left movement will soon meet to begin talks on how they will establish the newly created state and the future of the north."

America, Canada and Scotland have spoken with the Republic announcing they will work more closely with the South and ensure that if the North tries any type of aggression on the south they will fight with the Republic and restore the nation back.\n\nWith the declaration signed, the IRSM have taken a vote on who shall become leader of the newly born state. Two candidates have been chosen to be put on a ballot paper. Billy Hutchinson a radical socialist who wishes to work close with the U.S.B.R and invade the south creating an Irish Socialist Republic as well as helping England take the rest of the British Isle. On the other hand, there is the moderate socialist, Brian Ervine who also believes taking the republic and working with England is important but try and keep key elements of some democratic areas in the state."

Gathering in the halls of the old Capitol Building, ministers and representatives from across the Union now ready themselves to convene as the nation watches with baited breath while these masters of the political stage debate on the future of the Monarchy and the House of Norton. \n\nAlready a media circus within moments of starting, the media has descended upon the summit like hounds looking for their next easy meal. Not skipping a beat, the ‘darling’ of the public’s attention Bill Clinton has been lapping up airtime as much as he can while constantly floating and toying with the idea of running for Prime Minister on a platform of staunch Republicanism, though tacitly he still endorses and pushes the ticket of his wife Hillary. Aside from this media whore, many divisive and prominent figures within the American political sphere have shown up, from Al Gore to Cornel West, each lending their expertise and opinions to the fierce and ongoing debate on if the Norton monarchy has any place in modern America."

However, just because little collective ground was achieved, that is not to say the conference did not result in meaningful changes or happenings. Among the most notable, Al Gore officially nominated Bill Clinton for Prime Minister, who still dances on the fence of running or not, the vitriolic atmosphere of America’s internal politics was further showcased to the American people, and a clear atmosphere of rising Republican attitudes has been witnessed. All in all, the stability of the Commonwealth has now only been further drawn into question as the cracks begin to show in Emperor Norton’s prime political support base. Even now, threats to Prime Minister Sanders’ dominance have begun to surface, with many even calling for Secretary of Labor West, Bernie’s main political ally and confidant, to resign. In the past, the Bernie Administration could look past these empty threats, but with his poll numbers slipping and with the rise of discontent, his primacy and the stability of his party have been increasingly called into question. Though no final decision about the monarchy was reached, it is clear now that this situation is untenable, and the Union must adapt face, lest it face the dire consequences."

Sanders immediately began to campaign and plan for the 2016 Election in the hopes he could pull off what only Grover Cleveland had done before.

Sanders refused to comment on who he wanted his new running mate to be until he won the 2016 Commonwealth Primaries. \n\nThat day has arrived, and Sanders announced that Donald Trump, businessman, and former GOP candidate, would be his running mate. Trump's selection seems to be an olive branch to the GOP as that was the main reason for his loss in 2012. In addition, Trump's brand of "people's" democracy could help sway over Progressive Party voters in the hope of building a left-wing coalition to bring Sanders to victory this year. The press has gone wild with the announcement as hit pieces on Trump's controversial comments and actions have again come to the public consciousness.

The Entente military labelled him "High Value Target Number One" and began one of the largest manhunts in history. Many unsuccessful raids to find Trudeau were taken but even with high intelligence the ‘Red Chairman’ could not be found until a new operation took place which gained actionable intelligence identifying two likely locations.\n\nOperation Red Chair was launched and involved two squadron units both mixed of American and Canadian forces landing in key locations in Canada, Nain part of Newfoundland and Old Crow, Yukon. Both places isolated and the perfect hiding place for Trudeau. The first location Nain was cleared with no sign of Trudeau but when the second unit landed in Yukon they were met with fierce gun fire as shots came out of caravans and small wooden huts. As the unit pushed forward easily defeating the militia group, they were met with a squad of militias firing out of a larger wooden building, once the building had been cleared of gunfire the squad moved in to find Trudeau preparing to reload his pistol, a solider ran over and beat him with the stock of his M4.\n\nTrudeau was then arrested although screaming and shouting doing his best to try and wiggle out of the arms of the soldiers, a bag was put over his head to prevent him from seeing where he was. He was placed into a Boeing CH-47 Chinook and taken to Entente headquarters to face questioning. After the capture, news of his arrest made it into the news with many countries around the world celebrating the capture of one of the worst most dangerous men alive unlike the U.S.B.R criticizing the operation and ordering the immediate release of him and for him to be taken under their authority, something which would never happen.

Since taking control Mugabe has remained in power for decades and prevented the economy of the federation to grow instead he used the money on himself to create a lavish lifestyle, he was once viewed as a hero for Africa but is now looked upon as a dictator who allows poverty and authorism to grip the nation while the elite party.\n\nClinton has called for the people to look at the other nations of the world who embrace democracy and the freedoms given to them and order the government to introduce reforms which can change the nation to truly be a government for the people not just the rich and elite. She has ordered her government to spread western propaganda to the Federation and give the people a true look inside a democratic nation as well as showing that the America Empire will help out the people if the African government cannot."

The Americans have begun planting propaganda around Korea about what freedom really is and how there are others in the nation who want to free the people. The people outnumber the political class and if they all join together united they can bring down the dictatorship and a new Korean republic can be born out of the ashes of the dictatorship."

For decades now, those in the American catholic community have pleaded with the papacy to canonize Phillip for his work both during and after the Second American Civil War with the various civilian populations affected by conflict.\n\nDuring the war, the man did not discriminate in caring for individuals. After the war, his charity only reached wider audiences. In major cities devastated by conflict the man opened soup kitchens, organized clothing drives, and helped rebuild churches in many areas that were still considered unsafe. Among those duties, he helped to bring people Elijah Muhammad, a staunch muslim man back into the faith of Christ. While disagreeing with them vehemently he worked with the black jewish group “Sons Of Israel” to provide housing for black populations in the ex “Constitutional American Republic”.It’s even said that when visiting Chicago on a relief mission, he administered confession to Al Capone.\n\nIn a statement the Vatican said “General Carol worked tirelessly in his emulation of Christ. In a time where the world lost its way and dove into conflict, Phillip Carol was there to remind people of Christs love and affection. It is with honor that Pope Gregory will consecrate him as the patron saint of civilians in conflict.”"

His location is currently unknown.\n\nIt is believed that the Pie or pieces of the Pie when connected can transport an individual or group back in time or into a completely different reality. Similar metals have been found in Project 002.\n\nDr. William Lazar believes that the Pizza Pie is not exactly in our reality but instead is in every reality while not being in any reality. He among others believes that the Pie, while suicidal can be used to travel forward or backward in time to correct the mistakes of our current selves.  Although it would be hard to prove the concept of time travel, let alone interdimensional travel."

Thatcher was given command of an army group and won a decisive battle over Scottish forces at the town of Berwick on the border of Scotland and England, for which she won the first of her four Hero of the Union awards.\n\nThatcher was known for her brutal treatment of prisoners given her the title of ‘The Iron Lady’ for her lack of emotions and leadership style over the army, many enemies feared her and would take their own lives rather than be captured by her. In 1976 she served under Michael Foot as general of the Union army and many believed she would soon become the next leader until Tony Blair put his name forward quickly taking over the leadership competition. After Blairs take over Thatcher was becoming old and was forced into retirement to only be seen during political meetings and meeting with armies during trainings.\n\nMany nations around the world have celebrated her death after the Iron Lady constantly ordered threats to the likes of Scotland where Gordon Brown, one of the political leaders was stated saying “"I say good riddance” and many taking to the streets partying and chanting “The Wicked Witch is Dead”. Canada and America have said it is monitoring the situation and is prepared to stand behind its allies in the region, Scotland, Wales and Ireland."

 news.26.d:0 "The U.S.B.R has launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile over the Kingdom of Iceland for the first time, on Tuesday the government of Iceland said, a dramatic escalation that prompted Iceland to issue a rare alert for residents to take cover. Defence Minister of Denmark who works closely with Iceland said the weapon flew 4,600 kilometres — the longest distance ever travelled by a English missile — flying for about one minute over Shetland Islands before eventually landing in the Ocean some 3,200 km from Iceland. Leader of the Iceland Kingdom said, “The missile launch was an extremely dangerous act, and it seems even our peaceful nation of Iceland are now under threat, England’s series of actions, including the launches of ballistic missiles are a threat to the peace and security of our region and the international community and must not be tolerated,” \n\n In Edinburgh, Scottish King Francis condemned the launch, saying that it would be met with a “resolute” response from the country, its allies and the international community. London’s continued provocations would only serve to strengthen security cooperation with the U.S., Scotland and other partners outside the region, according to the Royal Office.\n\nIn a response to this the Kingdom of Canada and Empire of America worked together to deploy supersonic bombers and fighter jets which dropped bombs in the North sea and near the harbours of England to serve as a warning to Tony Blair. The US also stated that the U.S.B.R firing of a ballistic missile over Iceland as "dangerous and reckless" and pledged to defend Iceland and Scotland with all America's power, but said it remained open to dialogue with London."
