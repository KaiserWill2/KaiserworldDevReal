 cascadia.91.t:0 "Telfer to Step Down"
 cascadia.91.d:0 "With the recent transition of power from former Marshal Stencel to National Executive Ian Telfer, the government has wasted little time in announcing further reform to the government beginning with the immediate abolishment of the office of National Executive. With leading figures in Orecorp demanding increased representation for the various businesses housed in Cascadia, particularly Orecorp itself, the decision has been taken to abolish the National Executive and have it replaced with a Board of Shareholders. This Board of Shareholders, made up of prominent shareholders and CEOs in major businesses across Cascadia, will in effect become the new legislative and executive branch of government tasked with ensuring the continued stability of Cascadia and enshrining new legislation into law. With one hundred representatives, and a speaker to weigh in should there ever be a tie, the Board of Shareholders has been compared to the old United States Congress with the real difference being the lack of elected officials. With this radical change to the nation's political system, it is evident that Orecorp has tightened its grasp over the nation's politics and solidified the corporatocratic doctrine into the new state."
 cascadia.91.o1:0 "The Board of Shareholders will be more effective than any National Executive or Marshal"
 cascadia.92.t:0 "Ian Telfer Addresses the Nation"
 cascadia.92.d:0 "Today, in his first address to the nation following Marshal Stencel’s resignation from his position, National Executive Ian Telfer has announced the continuation of his position as the sole leader of the nation following fierce debate and discussion with shareholders and other leading officials in Orecorp. Many had anticipated that Orecorp would have demanded Telfer’s resignation and the further restructuring of the Cascadian state, however, today the National Executive has denied any such further reform to the government is coming and that for the foreseeable future he shall rule as Cascadia’s sole leader, maintaining the corporate alliance but not bending his knee to their demands. As his address continued, Telfer extended his thanks to former Marshal Stencel for securing the nation and allowing the true will of the Cascadian people to be achieved. Finishing his speech, the National Executive thanked the people of Cascadia for their patience and ensured that changes to the economy would soon be at hand to eradicate the last vestiges of socialism from the nation."

 cascadia.93.t:0 "Foresting Profits Skyrocket"
 cascadia.93.d:0 "The markets have today seen a significant spike in their peak value following the government's decision to rescind all existing foresting laws and regulations. Such a decision has already seen corporations expand their existing land by up to twenty percent as forests once protected by the government, either due to restrictions to the amount of forestry that can be removed or due to the wildlife living in the region, now have been bought out by the various corporations across Cascadia. These purchases have allowed for companies to greatly expand their existing presence across the nation and has allowed for the housing markets to also claim a stake where new homes and apartment complexes are now already under development. Despite the evident rise in profits for various companies across the nation, revealing the effectiveness of this repeal, various anarchists and so-called “Tree-huggers” have taken to these forests to protest against our repeal by tying themselves to trees significantly delaying the process. However, the government has already ensured that corporations are protected from any harm that will come to these protestors in the event of their injury at one of the construction sites."
 cascadia.93.o1:0 "Damn hippies"
 cascadia.94.t:0 "Merging of the OreCorp Branches"
 cascadia.94.d:0 "Up to this point, OreCorp Canada and OreCorp Cascadia have operated largely independent of one another, operating under different presidents and officers, despite much crossover between their boards of directors. That changes today, with the official merging of the two corporate branches, consolidating the company’s directory in the Ottawa headquarters. While OreCorp Cascadia’s rule over Cascadia could certainly be considered a mostly home-grown corporate rule, it’s much harder to say that now, with all of Cascadia now being almost entirely beholden to the directives of Ottawa. While some may complain about this sudden shift towards foreign control, the impending economic benefits cannot be overstated. With power consolidated, bureaucracy has been cut down, and OreCorp has been given access to a greater amount of capital, increasing its capacity to conduct further investments. Presuming that the newly centralized OreCorp plans on following the precedents of OreCorp Cascadia, one can only imagine the heights the country’s economic prosperity is set to reach now."
 cascadia.94.o1:0 "Onwards, to greater economic ventures!"
 cascadia.95.t:0 "Stock Market Predictions High"
 cascadia.95.d:0 "With Orecorp’s recent seizure of power, various reports have been circulating about the company's plans to reform the economy and bring about a nation entirely favorable to its corporations. Now in a televised speech a spokesperson has today come forward on behalf of the government to announce these plans and detail the various reforms that will be brought to Cascadia. Throughout the speech the spokesperson referred to the tackling of international trade restrictions, opening the state up to investment from all corners of the globe, and deepening ties with Canada. By the end of the speech, the markets had already reacted to the government's proposals with the stock market seeing a significant spike across all fronts with companies reporting at minimum a three percent rise and Orecorp itself a nine percent rise. With more reforms soon to be brought into effect, with plans to begin exporting the Cascadian workforce to Canada to aid in their development, the stock market seems to be on track for its most profitable year since the establishment of Cascadia with a continued rise likely."
 cascadia.95.o1:0 "Orecorp will bring about a profitable future for all"
 cascadia.96.t:0 "The First Telfer Economic Convention"
 cascadia.96.d:0 "A few short years ago, no one could have imagined Seattle as the centerpiece of a new corporate boom in the Pacific Northwest. And yet, this week, the city served as the host of a major new meeting of international investors. Dubbed the Telfer Convention, in honor of the OreCorp executive who molded Cascadia into the nation it is today. Over the course of the convention, businessmen and women from all across the globe were given a grand overview of the endless opportunities contained in Cascadia, from the lucrative foresting and staple mining industry, to the more traditional fishing operations and forward-thinking technology firms. The profits from the copious investments made during this convention are still being calculated, but they have already set new records for the region, outpacing even its profitability during the height of American economic power. As should be expected in light of such good news, OreCorp shareholders are over the moon with the sudden increase in the company’s market cap."
 cascadia.96.o1:0 "We have got to have money"
 cascadia.97.t:0 "Leftist Leadership Outraged"
 cascadia.97.d:0 "A collection of left wing politicians and activists have taken to the streets in protest over the last several days in response to the recently officiated ban on socialist political parties. Referring to this ban as an “attack on democracy” and a “concerted effort to silence the will of the people,” they are currently demanding that we repeal this legislation. Of course, this won’t happen. Purging the corrupt and unstable socialist regime of Stine was an incredibly difficult task, and it would be a struggle to replicate it in the event of another such figure crawling into power. Thus, we cannot let these idealistic and misguided radicals pressure us into putting the entirety of Cascadia at risk once more. Given enough time, these protests will almost certainly subside, and if they don’t we can always send in the military to force them into submission."
 cascadia.97.o1:0 "They don’t even know what they’re asking for!"
 cascadia.99.t:0 "Hilary Franz Missing"
 cascadia.99.d:0 "Worrying news from Bainbridge Island today, as information comes in concerning the  disappearance of Labor Front leader Hilary Franz. This situation began to develop when the friends and family of the leftist figurehead started calling various police precincts to report that Franz had been neither seen nor heard from in over two weeks. While some dissidents of the government blame our new program of hiring secret police to help patrol and secure stability in our nation, a self-conducted investigation has found no tangible evidence with which to connect the disappearance of Hilary Franz to the Cascadian state. This situation has thrown the leadership of the Labor Front into disarray, and the current party deputy, Doug Barnes, has now taken the helm of the party, leading it to an uncertain future. [CSD.GetLeader] made no official comments on Franz’s missing status, with insider reports claiming that little action is being taken to resolve this clearly less than pressing issue. The current list of suspects consists of far-right extremists, communist remnants, or Franz herself. However, some analysts say that it’s highly unlikely that Hilary will ever be found, considering the record of missing person cases in the Puget Sound area. "
 cascadia.99.o1:0 "She probably just decided to take a secret vacation"
 cascadia.100.t:0 "Stencel's Coup Declared a National Holiday"
 cascadia.100.d:0 "Revolution is never a simple task, it is a chaotic and violent affair, and, as was clearly displayed by the radical socialist takeover of Cascadia following the securing of our independence from the communist dictatorship of the Union of American People’s Republics. Thankfully, Marshal Stencel and his heroic allies were able to turn the tide of radicalism and deliver Cascadia from certain doom by deposing the horrendous Stine administration. With Cascadia having been completely changed in the time since Stencel’s coup, the current administration has decided that it is only fitting to commemorate the solidification of the new Cascadian regime by the declaration of a new national holiday. Going forward, the anniversary of Stencel’s coup will be celebrated every year, with the government sponsoring major revised parades in many of Cascadia’s largest cities. Of course, this move is not merely a feel-good celebration of the triumph against socialism. After all, it’s no secret that there has been a degree of ongoing resistance to Cascadia’s new regime, and so the declaration of this holiday may serve as an effective propaganda campaign that will, in time, hopefully reduce opposition."
 cascadia.100.o1:0 "Thank you Marshal Stencel!"
 cascadia.101.t:0 "Independence Members flip to the National Party"
 cascadia.101.d:0 "The movement that brought about Cascadian independence was a notoriously chaotic one, composed of all manners of anti-communists, from radical socialists to liberals to staunch nationalists. For quite some time, one of the most prominent stances serving to unite these otherwise disparate factions was a focus on environmentalism, with most groups in agreement about the preservation of Cascadia’s natural environment and incredible biodiversity. However, since rising to power, the National Party has proven more willing than others to diverge from this environmentalist platform. While this change in direction has proven unpopular with many in Cascadia, it has provoked some officials to actually change party positions to support the National Party. In particular, several members within the nationalist Independence Party have officially turned over to the National Party, leading many citizens to the conclusion that they had only ever feigned an interest in environmentalism in order to secure votes, and are just showing their true colors now that the National Party has demonstrated that environmentalism isn’t a necessary stance for Cascadian politicians any longer."
 cascadia.101.o1:0 "We welcome our new party members"
 cascadia.102.t:0 "Elwha Dams Reopened"
 cascadia.102.d:0 "Amidst the various industrial megaprojects that the government has undertaken over the last several months, perhaps one of the most impressive has been the restoration and reopening of the Elwha Dam. Bridging the gap across the Elwha River in the picturesque Olympic peninsula, the dam has lay dormant for decades, it was announced today that the dam has been fully restored to working order, and will begin operations immediately. Bearing the new name of Pinchot Dam, in honor of a famous American foresting entrepreneur, the restoration of the dam will provide new opportunities for hydroelectric power generation, helping to more reliably keep the lights on throughout our country, and the damming of the river has obviously opened up new avenues for irrigation with which to support our country’s agricultural sector. However, the reopening of Pinchot Dam has not received universal praise. Many environmentalists have taken issue with the announcement, claiming that the dam will destroy “vital ecosystems” in the country. However, their juvenile and misguided protests have remained small in scale, and have been largely ignored."
 cascadia.102.o1:0 "The heart of a new Cascadia"
 cascadia.103.t:0 "Michael Stencel sworn in as Prime Minister"
 cascadia.103.d:0 "This morning, it was announced that Marshal Michael Stencel has become Prime Minister of Cascadia following the merging of the two offices. Henceforth, all prime ministers will be marshals, and vice versa. It is worth noting that no electoral institution has been established for selecting prime ministers, and parliament still remains dissolved. Additionally, no rules on term limits have been established, nor has any major system of codified checks and balances been implemented to curtail the powers of the executive office. As a result, many have criticized Stencel’s adoption of the title of Prime Minister as a purely performative decision done to win credibility. That said, this revival of a traditionally civilian political office has helped our country to appear at least slightly more legitimate in the international community, as we can at least claim to have some vestiges of democracy rather than being a simple military dictatorship. Prime Minister Stencel has already reaffirmed his commitment to guiding the country to reach the fullest extent of its potential."
 cascadia.103.o1:0 "Whatever his title, he is Cascadia’s hero"
 cascadia.104.t:0 "Prime Minister Stencel’s Address"
 cascadia.104.d:0 "Since taking control of Cascadia, Prime Minister Michael Stencel’s plans and policies have primarily centered around returning some semblance of stability to the strife-ridden nation. With the chaos seeming to have finally been conquered, the time has come to begin real reforms in the country. To that end, Stencel today unveiled his plans for the nation going forward, outlining a list of government reforms and projects and commitments that he believes will help make Cascadia the most powerful country it can possibly be. This plan includes a new slew of economic changes to reaffirm the government’s commitment to protecting private land ownership and promoting free market economics. That said, Stencel’s plan does still outline an avenue for which the state can give directions to private businesses, particularly those involved in research and development projects deemed to be of interest to national security. While Stencel appears to have been purposefully vague in his public address with regards to fully outlining what this means, the educated assumption is that the Marshal can strongly influence exactly what technologies are being studied or pursued by various research and development labs."
 cascadia.104.o1:0 "We stand on the precipice of a new Cascadia!"
 cascadia.105.t:0 "Ministry of Extraordinary Research Established"
 cascadia.105.d:0 "As was outlined in Prime Minister Michael Stencel’s recently unveiled plan for the future of Cascadia, the government has taken a more proactive role in directing the nation’s research institutes via the creation of the Ministry of Extraordinary Research. Between outright orders on what to research or comparatively subtle specified research grants, the ministry has wasted no time in ensuring that technological development in the country has progressed exclusively according to the desires of the National Party’s vision. The vast majority of these directives from Stencel and his administration are confidential and kept away from the eyes of the public, though official documents have detailed a focus on developing technologies that will “improve the living conditions of all people in the nation”. However, leaks do happen, and, while their credibility has certainly been called into question by Stencel and his party, they point to the Ministry of Extraordinary Research having diverted the vast majority of research groups’ focus towards the development of new military technology. If true, these leaks would surprise few, given the nationalistic militarism that has dominated Stencel’s government. After all, Stencel himself is also the nation’s Marshal, and was a soldier long before he was a politician."
 cascadia.105.o1:0 "Stencel is keeping Cascadia safe"
 cascadia.106.t:0 "Project Skookum Announced"
 cascadia.106.d:0 "The newly founded Ministry of Extraordinary Research has already been making itself known to the various centers of technological advancement in Cascadia, providing a gentle guiding hand to encourage them to pursue the projects that will benefit the country the most. Most of the details of their interventions have been heavily classified and unavailable to the public. However, following a major leak, information on something known as Project Skookum began to make its way out to the public. Rather than deny its existence, Prime Minister Stencel and his administration have elected to properly announce the project. Project Skookum, named for the Pacific Northwest Chinook Jargon word for “strong” or “powerful,” is a new directive from the Ministry of Extraordinary Research regarding the development of a nuclear program in Cascadia. While the prospect of nuclear energy is a part of the program, and an aspect that Stencel focused on during the announcement, it’s clear that the majority of resources are being spent on the creation of nuclear weapons. Armed with nuclear weapons, foreign nations would have to be utterly insane to attack Cascadia, and the mostly clean energy provided by nuclear reactors is an added bonus."
 cascadia.106.o1:0 "This will safeguard Cascadia!"
 cascadia.107.t:0 "National Council Founded"
 cascadia.107.d:0 "Since coming to power in Cascadia, Prime Minister Michael Stencel and his National Party have made a point of tying themselves to the ongoings of the various businesses and corporations in the country. This should come as no surprise, given that many of these businesses had been staunch supporters of the coup that put Stencel in power. To codify this sort of de facto connection between the state and the firms operating inside of it into law, the formation of the National Council was announced this morning. This council is made up of a collection of Cascadia’s most successful and influential corporate figures, and has been granted the important job of advising Stencel on economic matters and helping to draft fiscal legislation. Naturally, any decision the council reaches is subject to approval by Prime Minister Stencel, but its foundation has still sparked a small degree of controversy among those who feel that the very existence of the National Council is an inherent conflict of interests. However, these people are mainly either radical leftists or right wing populists. The latter will learn in time that the council only stands to benefit them, and the former is hellbent on stubbornly opposing our government at every turn anyway."
 cascadia.107.o1:0 "The National Council will guide Cascadia to greatness!"
 cascadia.108.t:0 "The Council’s Spokesperson"
 cascadia.108.d:0 "With the formation of the National Council, the time has come to select its spokesperson, the figure that will present its agendas and recommendations to Prime Minister Stencel. A number of candidates have risen to prominence recently, and each of them could serve as a recognizable and responsible spokesperson. First there is Dutch-Cascadian media technology mogol Robert Monster, a dedicated Cascadian nationalist and incredibly successful in his pursuit of forward-thinking technological developments. Next there is Solomon Yue, a Chinese-Cascadian businessman of great repute, shares many of Monster’s nationalistic views, and has been more actively tied to political ongoings in the nation for quite some time now. Another option is Terry Emmert, an engineering and transportation businessman who has, for the most part, remained fairly quiet in the political field up until now. Finally, there is Paul Allen. The co-founder of the now long dead Microsoft, Allen has spent his life as a computing technology innovator and major philanthropist. Each of these men is a genius in their own right, it simply remains up to Prime Minister Stencel who is most deserving of the prestigious post of National Council Spokesperson."

 cascadia.108.o4:0 "Solomon Yue"
 cascadia.109.t:0 "The Council Convenes"
 cascadia.109.d:0 "With its institutions set in stone at last and a spokesperson selected, the National Council has spent the last few weeks debating the model that it believes the Cascadian economy should follow going forward. After much deliberation, the final proposal was presented before Prime Minister Stencel, who promptly lended it his executive approval. Under this new directive from the National Council, the organization of the economy will be heavily decentralized, with the role of the government vastly reduced. While Stencel and the Ministry of Extraordinary Research will still retain a powerful influence over research priorities, private businesses will otherwise have total control over their actions. To help support this new plan, almost the entirety of Cascadia’s forests have been privatized, opening them up to real estate, foresting, and mining companies. While some feel that this can only lead to the destruction of Cascadia’s unique ecology or that this economic devolution will weaken the government too much, all signs point to a new economic boom waiting just around the proverbial corner."
 cascadia.109.o1:0 "The economy belongs in private hands"
 cascadia.110.t:0 "Surge of Eco-Terrorism"
 cascadia.110.d:0 "In the early days of the Cascadian independence movement, few topics were as prevalent as that of environmentalism. However, the administration of Marshal and Prime Minister Michael Stencel has marked a clear departure from this standpoint, and the National Party has continued to prioritize economic expansion and business interests over the issue of environmentalism, much to the chagrin of many of the people who had initially fought to win independence for Cascadia. It seems that these environmentalists have finally had enough of the government turning their backs to their interests, as incidents of eco-terrorism have significantly jumped in frequency as of late. There have been countless cases of foresting and mining equipment being rendered inoperable, and last week there were even a few suspects arrested over the discovery of a plot to sabotage Pinchot Damn. Investigations and precautions are already being taken to put an end to these acts of terrorism, but it has clearly demonstrated that our righteous rule is not recognized by everyone in Cascadia."
 cascadia.110.o1:0 "Terrorism is a tool of the weak"
 cascadia.111.t:0 "Growth in Uranium Extraction"
 cascadia.111.d:0 "With the fall of the utterly reprehensible Spencer regime of the Union of Lincoln, the new lands added to Cascadia have placed new resources at our disposal. Evidently, Spencer had expended a significant portion of his nation’s capital on the development of nuclear industry in Idaho. The infrastructure built to support this project is still largely intact, and Cascadian workers have already begun extracting large quantities of uranium from the various mines that dot the Sawtooth Mountains. Naturally, after seeing the wealth of Idaho’s soil, a significant number of new uranium mines have also begun construction. In addition to copious access to uranium, Cascadian military researchers have also discovered a wealth of blueprints and research documents regarding new nuclear technologies, which will certainly come in handy for the development and expansion of our own nuclear projects. These discoveries are a most welcome surprise to find in the ashes of our fallen foes, and have made these new lands that much more valuable."
 cascadia.111.o1:0 "Dig deep and greedily!"
 cascadia.112.t:0 "Compromise Reached with Militias"
 cascadia.112.d:0 "The various militias that made up the state apparatus of Montana present a particular concern for Cascadia now that we occupy their country. These militias were at least partially in collaboration with our now-vanquished enemies, and they now represent a dissident collection of decentralized and heavily armed dissidents. Needless to say, such a thing is less than healthy for the stability of a nation. Because fully repressing or crushing these militia groups would undoubtedly be an arduous task, [CSD.GetLeader] has elected instead to reach a compromise with the militias. Under the terms of this compromise, the militias will be reorganized into private military companies, available for hire by the highest bidder and owing a small portion of their profits to the Cascadian state. In return for these generous terms, militia leaders have sworn to do their best to separate from their white nationalist background, as such an extreme position tends to be bad optics, and thus unprofitable for a private company. While not everyone in Cascadia is thrilled to see these former foes repurposed into a money-making opportunity, it’s clearly the most mutually beneficial and peaceful compromise that could be reached in this situation."
 cascadia.112.o1:0 "Here’s to mutual profits!"
 cascadia.113.t:0 "Student Demonstration at Portland State University"
 cascadia.113.d:0 "To put it lightly, the youth seems to strongly disapprove of our national policiy. Driven by resentment over perceived “political suppression” of radical socialist subversion and an attachment to the environment, the students of Portland State University have organized a sit-in on their campus, demanding “freedom” and “respect for the environment”. Additionally, the faculty has been suspiciously slow to react, which has alarmed local authorities who suspect they are sympathetic to the student cause. Regardless, police chief Michael Marshman has assured us the situation will be under control soon, so the central government won’t step in… yet. The city’s police have begun an operation to disperse the rabble and return the university to normal function, hoping to intimidate the students with a show of force. The mayor of Portland has also made clear that disorder won’t be tolerated."
 cascadia.113.o1:0 "Who do these hippies think they are?"
 cascadia.114.t:0 "Student Protests Expand"
 cascadia.114.d:0 "The police’s response has not had the desired result. Though it was expected that the usual protocol for student unrest would pay off, the results on the ground tell a different story. Instead of standing down, the protesters held the line and even inspired sympathizers outside the university to take to the streets and air their own grievances against the government. Overwhelmed, the police were forced to withdraw from the premises of the university and regroup. In the meantime, other areas have seen sparse dissident activity, raising concerns that we are about to experience something far more dire than a simple sit-in. The national guard is gearing for a confrontation, and it’s expected that [CSD.GetLeader] will intervene personally if the situation continues to deteriorate."
 cascadia.114.o1:0 "This is getting out of hand, now there are more of them!"
 cascadia.115.t:0 "Demonstrations Reach Seattle"
 cascadia.115.d:0 "As it turns out, our concerns weren’t unfounded. This morning, a protest broke out in central Seattle. This protest has been mostly peaceful, with young and old participating in a march across the city’s streets, disrupting the traffic flow along with the daily routine of hundreds of thousands of law-abiding citizens. These starry-eyed idealists hope that their show of unity will get through to the government. However, we have no interest in discussion with socialists who dare undermine our order in our own capital. [CSD.GetLeader] has already ordered the national guard to quash this revolt in its cradle, before it has the opportunity to spark something even bigger. The stage is set, and we will triumph over those who seek to throw us back into the red tyranny of the UAPR."
 cascadia.115.o1:0 "Crush Them!"
 cascadia.116.t:0 "Protests Turn Violent"
 cascadia.116.d:0 "The national guard has been deployed, but as we feared, it was already too late to entirely preempt disorder on the streets. Even in a cloud of smoke and crying gas, the protesters have persisted, and have now increasingly resorted to violent tactics, having come to realize that they won’t be listened to. These radicals are setting fire to trash cans, setting up barricades on the streets and even vandalising government property in an obvious effort to overturn our newfound peace and stability! The national guard is unable to cope with this development and is now lying in wait for reinforcements as crowds of outraged activists advance on the Portland police department headquarters. Thanks to the Seattle march, we now have to focus on two fronts at once. The situation is spinning out of control, and if it does, it could spell an early end to our attempts to restore freedom and prosperity to our troubled region."
 cascadia.116.o1:0 "This is madness!"
 cascadia.117.t:0 "Leftists Occupy Portland"
 cascadia.117.d:0 "Although we were aware the situation was becoming untenable, we never could have foreseen our current predicament. It appears that, somehow, the leftist insurrectionists in Portland have acquired military-grade weapons and used them to fight off a panicking national guard, establishing an “autonomous zone” in several districts of Portland. The area has been cleared of police and the local department was burnt down overnight, and although it is a relatively small zone, the fight has seen 9 soldiers killed and many more injured. The most concerning aspect of this affair is the presence of weaponry civilians would regularly have no access to; where did they come from? Once this is over, [CSD.GetLeader] has ordered the investigation of independence war caches and veterans alike, but before that happens, his government will need to survive the coming storm. It’s become clear the armed forces will need to step in to prevent a total collapse of the regime. As the stand-off increasingly resembles a civil war, troops stationed around the anarchists’ barricades received a simple order."
 cascadia.117.o1:0 "Fire at will"
 cascadia.118.t:0 "Military Deployed in Urban Regions"
 cascadia.118.d:0 "With the military ordered to take drastic measures against the growing tide of socialism threatening to sweep away the foundations of our state, it was finally possible to retake the so-called autonomous zone established in Portland. Screams echoed through the night as armored vehicles barreled past walls of trash and traffic blockades, as well as anyone manning them. The anarchists that made it out of the carnage fled the area under heavy gunfire. Of course, such an operation would necessarily have casualties, including some students and elderly people protesting for a stronger social safety net. However, it was a necessary sacrifice to restore order to the streets and prevent far deadlier instability, and the cost of the lives of a few subversives was one Cascadia simply had to pay, even amid unfounded rumours of bystanders being gunned down by soldiers on the perimeter. The military, in conjunction with the police, has begun a manhunt to apprehend every last subversive still on the streets, whatever it takes."

 cascadia.119.t:0 "Socialist Bomb Plot Defused"
 cascadia.119.d:0 "During a patrol around the Capitol building in the early hours of the morning, Seattle police encountered a group of youth suspiciously loitering near a side entrance of the building. In regular times, they might have overlooked them, but owing to the recent socialist unrest they decided to search their belongings and question them. Shockingly, they discovered a number of makeshift tools clearly designed to breach the premises of the building, as well as an improvised explosive device. The bomb was safely defused and the youth taken in for interrogation, and it was quickly revealed that they belonged to an organisation named the Seattle Resistance Front, which had been on a government watchlist for suspected terrorist activity for months. As it turns out, this failed plot was a boon for us, as high media coverage focusing on the potential loss of civilian life had the plot been successful has greatly alienated our citizens from the students’ cause. With the “autonomous zone” in Portland already pacified, things have now taken a decisive turn in our favor."
 cascadia.119.o1:0 "Pathetic"
 cascadia.120.t:0 "Organizers Trialed"
 cascadia.120.d:0 "As the chaos in the cities has subsided, the police have been able to round up the chief instigators of the violent insurrection that shook our nation to the core. These terrorists are radicalized university students whose ultimate goal was to overthrow our rule of law and replace it with socialist anarchy, not unlike that of the extinct UAPR. As a testament to the superiority of our just rule, these attempts woefully failed, and they now face trial for their treason. Everyone in our government agrees that they have forfeited their right to freedom for the rest of their lives, but many question if they have also forfeited their right to live at all. After all, their actions led to countless innocent deaths in Portland, as they hid behind civilians as human shields to carry out their schemes. Should their deaths not be avenged? However, our close ally to the north might be put in an uncomfortable situation were we to act in a “tyrannical” manner. Still, the decision hinges on the court system… and [CSD.GetLeader]."

 cascadia.121.t:0 "Celebration Held for Protest Veterans"
 cascadia.121.d:0 "With the situation now fully under control, [CSD.GetLeader] has decided it’s only appropriate to honor the veterans of the socialist insurrection. These heroic souls put their lives on the line to keep our cities safe from harm and preserve law and order. Many of them were injured in despicable acts of terrorism, while others suffer from post-traumatic stress from their experiences during the suppression of the Portland autonomous zone. While some heartless and unpatriotic voices might murmur that these heroes are murdered so-called “innocent students”, true Cascadians have shown their love and support for them in droves in several concurrent and highly publicized events, in which veterans were awarded medals and given gifts and praise by law-abiding citizens and their children. Naturally, these veterans will be granted generous pensions as a reward for their loyalty to our great country."
 cascadia.121.o1:0 "Thank you for your service"
 cascadia.122.t:0 "Portland Police Chief Fired"
 cascadia.122.d:0 "With peace finally restored in the Portland area and the protest organizers tried, it is time to turn our gaze inwards to find those within our own administration deserving of blame for the failure to prevent or contain the chaos. With nearly incalculable costs accrued in damage and general unrest spiking throughout the country, the military was forced to intervene to put down the protests and riots; this should never have been the military’s responsibility. It’s clear that the Portland City Police Department failed somewhere in their duty to uphold order, given that Portland was the beating heart of this revolt against our country. Launching a full scale investigation into the PCPD would be an extraneous waste of time and resources, and could potentially leave the department without experienced officers. Instead, the incompetence must be cut off at the source, and the easiest way to do this is to fire Chief of Police Michael Marshman. Mike Reese will step in to replace Marshman, and will hopefully prove more effective at doing what needs to be done to keep the peace in the future."

 cascadia.123.d:0 "Over the past several months, Cascadia has paid the price for failing to properly nurture the youth of the nation into responsible and loyal citizens. With so many young people either dead or imprisoned, and a nearly incalculable amount of damage dealt to both private and state property, it’s clear that the time has come to amend our shortcomings. In order to prevent such radical political ideologies from fermenting in school settings in the future, the Cascadian Patriotic Youth Association has been founded, and all schools in the country will be required to help facilitate their operations and presence. In essence, the Cascadian Patriotic Youth Association is committed to stoking Cascadian nationalism in young people throughout their lives, from elementary school to college. Through the organization, the students will be taught about the evils of communism and the great success of Cascadian capitalism since Stencel helped to eradicate the radical socialists from the country. The youth will also be taught more practical things, such as firearm safety and operation, and there are plans for the Youth Association to take students on field trips to various monuments, historical sites, shooting ranges, and other fun and educational adventures."

 cascadia.124.d:0 "Following the chaotic scenes in the recent coup against former President Stine’s administration, Marshal Stencel has sought to maintain his grasp over the nation for the foreseeable future. In a grand and public spectacle, Marshal Stencel has today marched a small detachment of loyal soldiers into the capital’s parliament building where those still loyal to the former democratic government were rounded up and now await trial for treason against the new government. Following the arrests, Marshal Stencel announced to the nation, in a televised address outside of parliament, that the “recently established halls of democracy would close their doors forevermore.” Stating that the reason behind the chaos in the fledgling Cascadian state was because of the weak democratic apparatus, Marshal Stencel has now passed into law the complete shutdown of all existing democratic institutions in Cascadia, centralizing all power to the new Marshal of Cascadia."

 cascadia.125.d:0 "Called by our incumbent Prime Minister Hilary Franz, the first democratic socialist election has now been called in our bioregion. Many expect Hilary Franz to maintain her position given the tight grasp of the Labour Front over politics. However, running in opposition to the Labour Front is the governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber. As a liberal-minded man, Kitzhaber has made his priorities known calling for furthered wildlife protection, cooperation with private business owners to establish a more mixed economy, and has demonstrated himself to be an enthusiastic human rights activist. However, some are concerned with his alleged relations with illegal drug planting, or the fact that his fiancee has been accused of using her position as a government official for her own personal gain. Hilary Franz has run a relentless ad campaign attacking the administration of Kitzhaber, using the stigma regarding his controversies to delegitimize his campaign and using it as an opportunity to show her own accomplishments. After months of campaigning, the people have now expressed their feelings towards the administration through the ballot. With the results incoming, it is clear that the winner of the 2017 Cascadian general elections is..."

 cascadia.126.d:0 "Today, the people of Cascadia go to the polls for a new general election, where the future of the nation is up to be decided at the ballot box. Running a strong campaign, incumbent PM Greg Walden has continuously championed the accomplishments of his premiership, and enjoys high popularity among the people, being dubbed the “Father of Independence” by the media. Fighting an uphill battle in the opposition is Jason Levin, who has run a campaign focusing on the environment, and a peaceful foreign policy. Both Walden and Levin agree on strong protection for the environment of Cascadia but diverge in other issues like conscription, the economy, and foreign policy. Polling has shown Walden in the lead consistently, and already The Seattle Times has revealed its headline for tomorrow morning showing a victory for the Cascadia Independence Party, but it’s never good to completely ignore the chance of an underdog victory. The results are in, and the election has been won by:"

 news.323.d:0 "The situation in Cascadia has been one of particular interest throughout the world, having bucked the control of the communist Union of American People’s Republics and had the subsequent government overthrown by a coup organized by Marshal Michael Stencel. The government that has risen in the wake of Stencel’s coup has not proved particularly popular, especially with the youth of the nation, who reject its undemocratic and hyper-capitalistic trends. While the nation has remained largely tight-lipped, preventing any serious leaks of information to the world at large, a new slew of testimonials has recently come to light thanks to the reports of parents who allegedly escaped the country following the execution of their children, university students from Portland. These parents have described a horrific picture of authoritarian rule in the Pacific Northwest, resisted in force by large groups of young, dedicated protesters, who were organized by their now-deceased children. The Cascadian state’s response to these initially peaceful protests was, by all accounts, utterly barbaric, with the police and military alike treating these protesters as foreign combatants rather than the people they were sworn to protect."

 news.324.d:0 "New reports have begun flooding in from Seattle this morning, detailing a shocking outcome to the most recent meeting of parliament. Following the tragic and surprising deaths of Prime Minister Kevin Stine and President Kate Brown, parliament had been scheduled to convene and elect a new head of government. However, this election was never to pass, as Michael Stencel, the head of Cascadia’s military, stormed the parliament building with support from a sizable detachment of the soldiers under his command. Stencel has declared the failure of the Stine administration and its “corrupt socialistic” policies and "temporarily" placed himself as the new head of both state and government for the time being, to “ensure the restoration of freedom” to Cascadia. Several media organizations have reached out to Stencel for further elaboration on his intentions for the country, but they have, by and large, received only a general promise that he will “fix” the small country and avoid stoking tensions with other nations to the best of his ability. This has been questioned by international observers, given Stencel’s position as the head of national security, but at the moment the only option is to wait and see what his new administration does with their new mandate."
