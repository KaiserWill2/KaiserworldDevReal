 ### GENERIC TREE
army_effort:0 "The Armed Forces"
army_effort_desc:0 "The army is the oldest and most needed form of military in todays day and age. A motherland needs its sons and daughters as much as it needs its food or air. And as technology advances, we need to help improve our armed forces, and make sure we beat time rather than fall behind it."
equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernization"
equipment_effort_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with. And though we will give something for them to fight with, we cant let it be stick vs sword with the odds in the enemy favor. So it seems like time to have an upgrade and finally have an update as we follow time with its endless progression."
motorization_effort:0 "Motorized Men"
motorization_effort_desc:0 "Our infantry is still human, and with heavy equipment and them often having to walk many kilometers on end at one point, it can drain our troop strength and eventually leave them exausted in battle. So lets make it easier for them, Lets move them in motorized vehichles! While this isn't rocket technology knowing it has been tried and used much before, we should still expand upon this technology as it is very useful."
doctrine_effort:0 "Doctrines of War"
doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Doctrines can be very useful in war as they decide how we fight. We should work on a sort of doctrine expansion and organization program which can help us come up with new ways of fighting while expanding upon the old ones."
equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Modernization II"
equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with. And though we will give something for them to fight with, we cant let it be stick vs sword with the odds in the enemy favor. So it seems like time to have an upgrade and finally have an update as we follow time with its endless progression. Now, while we have done this already before, might as well do it again."
mechanization_effort:0 "Mechs!"
mechanization_effort_desc:0 "While not actual Mech robots, sorry if I got your hopes up, actually im not. But back to the topic, mechanized vehichles can be used like motorized vehichles would, moving our troops faster and easier while keeping them ready for the fight. Pretty neat huh?"
doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrines of War II"
doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Doctrines can be very useful in war as they decide how we fight. We should work on a sort of doctrine expansion and organization program which can help us come up with new ways of fighting while expanding upon the old ones. Now, we have done this before but it never hurts to do it again. Actually, it helps!"
equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Modernization"
equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "Our army cant be fighting without something to fight with. And though we will give something for them to fight with, we cant let it be stick vs sword with the odds in the enemy favor. So it seems like time to have an upgrade and finally have an update as we follow time with its endless progression."
armor_effort:0 "Tanks"
armor_effort_desc:0 "The tank is a quite new technology, and that makes it seem both more powerful and futuristic! While now people are used to tanks, they still pack a punch on the field. So we should show our enemy who is boss with a pile of armor and shrapnel."
special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
special_forces_desc:0 "Ranging from mountains to seas, clouds to cities, Special forces are here to handle the many challenges that a normal soldier would  strugle with. Due to this we should work more on expanding our special forces to fit our army in a war."
aviation_effort:0 "The Air Force"

fighter_focus:0 "Fighters"
fighter_focus_desc:0 "The Fighters in the sky are those to hold the place they fight in. Without fighters we are unable to destroy the enemy air force and in the process lose the skies. So lets ramp up productions on these planes! Let us defend the skies in our favor!"
bomber_focus:0 "Bombers"
bomber_focus_desc:0 "Bombers are a great unit in the air, they are used for destroying cities, infastructure, or anything on the ground! We should begin production on more of this technology, and follow a strategy tried and tested many times before, Bomb the hell out of schools and hospitals. It always works!"
aviation_effort_2:0 "The Air Defence"
aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "As much as we need the ground and water, we also need the air. Now, an air force is pretty common these days, but we might need to expand it in case the enemy is much more powerful in the air. So, as we have done this before, lets do it again to further improve our air force and its defensive capabilities."
CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
CAS_effort_desc:0 "Close air support, or CAS is a very good technology for us to focus on as it can destroy the infantry and whatever other ground forces the opposing side has. So bringing up production and pushing a hole in our economy just for our big business to fix seems like an absolute win!"

flexible_navy:0 "Flexibility in the Navy"
flexible_navy_desc:0 "With our navy being quite large, it might be hard to move things or fight things in the right way. So making our navy more flexible could help us maneuver, attack, move, and kill much easier than before."
large_navy:0 "Numbers in our Navy"
large_navy_desc:0 "Ever since the beginning of time, brute force was the way to go. I mean, how bad would it scare you if youre on a small naval junkie, and all of a sudden a giant mass of metal and steaming sailors pulls up from nowhere! You would be spooked! God bless whatever poor soul would dare fight that thing."
submarine_effort:0 "Submarines"
