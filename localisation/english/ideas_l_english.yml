idea_pol_forgotten_partner:0 "The Forgotten Partner"
idea_pol_forgotten_partner_desc:0 "What was meant to be an equal union of Poles and Lithuanins in practice, in reality turned out to be Poland with an appendix. Almost all government functions are done in polish and the lithuanian culture is only barely represented anywhere. The Crown of Poland is also more developed than the GDL. For now the Lithuanians accept this state of things, but if anything would happen that would tip the balance even stronger in the polish favour, we might have a complete disaster at our hands."
idea_ala_memories_of_beringia:0 "Memories of Beringia"
idea_ala_memories_of_beringia_desc:0 "Beringia. A name that bring fear to some while meaning freedom, equality, and liberation to others. The nearly 60 years of Beringian rule over Alaska has completely transformed Alaskan culture and has left a significant impact on its people. Many still remember-even more so the American Indians-the days of Berinigia and how the real and truly Indian nation existed. But the 2002 Invasion from Prime Minister Jeb Bush's government changed everything, famine, death, and poverty became commonplace and the GDP completely tanked in Beringia. One could almost describe it as a frozen hell. The pain is still fresh, and the Alaskan government is unstable. Who knows what might happen next?"
idea_ala_weak_administration:0 "Weak Administration"
idea_ala_weak_administration_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Beringian War has left this country unstable and nearly lawless. The American Administration is laughable and barely has any semblance of control over the cities, let alone the countryside. Weak and vulnerable are two of the best descriptions to call the provisional government of Alaska."
idea_ala_impending_civil_war:0 "Looming Civil War"
idea_ala_impending_civil_war_desc:0 "With racial tensions inflamed and our economic woes hitting harder than ever, the great and independent state of the Alaskan people teeters on the edge of collapse. White and Indigenous paramilitaries openly brawl in city streets and forested tribal lands, each vying for supremacy and control over the Last Frontier, while the last shreds of nonviolent political discourse have all but completely deteriorated. As further innocent blood is spilled on the white, snowy fields of Alaska, it becomes ever more clear in the minds of all Alaskans- war is on the horizon, a war for the soul of the North."
idea_ala_racial_tension:0 "Racial Tensions"
idea_ala_racial_tension_desc:0 "For centuries, White and Red combatants have exchanged volleys of both lead and hatespeech as they have struggled to eke out a meager coexistence due to their forced proximity. These tensions have ebbed and flowed at different periods, but since the rise of the Towner regime in the 1930s, these tensions have evolved and been fueled into an atmosphere of full racial war. No one knows who will come out on top in the end, but after decades of these renewed hostilities that have been fermenting between the groups, a peaceful solution has become seemingly impossible. The nation tentatively waits for the coming bloodshed all expect, for it seems the people of Beringia will not give up their land to the White Man so easily yet again."
idea_ala_crumbling_infrastructure:0 "Crumbling Infrastructure"
idea_ala_crumbling_infrastructure_desc:0 "Due to the Beringian War, much of our nation’s infrastructure lies in ruin. From the roads of ALCAN that have fallen into total disarray to the train tracks of the ARR that have been left to mothball and decay, the few vital arteries Alaska has that allow it to circulate its goods and people are dying, and without a massive effort from the nation’s government, they will likely continue on this route until we are seized in gridlock over a lack of understructure required to run a modern state."

idea_ala_nonexistent_economy_desc:0 "After decades of brutal guerilla war and clashes between Red and White forces, the economy of the Last Frontier has been completely obliterated. With much of the oil refining equipment of Prudhoe Bay and the Northern Slope falling into disrepair and with other major industries dying along the way like our infamous logging and mining endeavors, Alaska’s third-world economy has is now only barely held afloat through careful control over a few key fishing sites around Alaska’s territorial waters. The Last Frontier is dying, and some change will be needed, and fast, if it is to stand any chance at surviving the coming storm."

Berniecare expands access to around 25% of the American population and gives the option of a government run health insurance. It was passed in a narrow margin in the House and the Senate before arriving on Prime Minister Sanders desk. Sanders's popularity has boomed after passing the act since it was a major campaign goal."

Blair spends most of the countries money on building up the army and focusing research into nuclear weapons while the people of the nation work long hours and starve while the elite dine together and take no notice of the rest of the people."
