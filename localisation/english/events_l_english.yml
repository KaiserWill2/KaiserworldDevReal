 England.1.t:0 "Welcome To The Union"
 England.1.d:0 "In the old days of the union Michael Foot lead the state until 1995 where he suffered from a stroke and passed away. Not long after the Hardliner brute who was in second command of the union, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair became leader. Within the first year of his rule England dramatically changed. From the year 2000-2005 Blair increased the isolationist nation preventing outside news leaking in. Blair also ensures total loyalty to him imprisoning anyone who speaks out against his rule. England is ruled with an iron fist and is ready for any war to break out with the population under strict law its unlikely anything is to change soon in the union.."

 England.4.t:0 "The Legacy Of Michael Foot"
 England.4.d:0 "Michael foot passed away leaving his deputy, Tony Blair to take charge. Blair, a military man, quickly rose through the ranks of the USBR military to Commanding General of the armed forces.

 England.4.o1:0 "The Hermit Kingdom"
 England.5.t:0 "Blairs Iron Fist"
 England.5.d:0 "Chairman Blair has sentenced many traitorous generals to death for their crimes against the eternal revolution. With this, many close family members have been placed under watch and some have been confined to their homes as he reforms the nation into something new. Not everyone can be trusted, as even Blair himself has come under the scrutiny of assassination attempts. Praise Blair for his reforms."
 England.5.o1:0 "Blair Strikes At His Own"
 England.6.t:0 "Blairs Weapon Research Order"
 England.6.d:0 "General Blair has ordered many of the USBR’s top scientists to focus more on the development of nuclear weapons than the needs of the people. Blairs logic is that once the USBR has the capability to launch nuclear missiles and liberate the rest of the world from the tyranny of monarchism, then the peoples needs will be met. For now they will have to sacrifice just that that bit for the nation."
 England.6.o1:0 "The Union Moves Forward"
 England.7.t:0 "The Weapon Parade"
 England.7.d:0 "In T.E. Lawrence Square, rockets, tanks, soldiers, and even jets march to show that the hermit state is ready and willing to defend itself.

 England.8.t:0 "We Love Blair!"
 England.8.d:0 "The people of the USBR must swear their total loyalty to the great leader, those who stand against him are traitors and will be punished.

 England.9.t:0 "The General's TV Broadcast"
 England.9.d:0 "General Blair has appeared on state television announcing the union is finally at a point where it is now able to defend itself against its enemies and is equipped for a modern age.

 England.9.o1:0 "General Blair Defends His People!"
 England.10.t:0 "The Union Economy Plan"
 England.10.d:0 "The unions economy has always needed support from other far left nations, although the nations have a surplus of oil thanks to the North Sea, many democratic nations refuse to trade with the union causing the economy to slump. Now is the time to finally fix the money problems and expand its friendships with other like-minded leaders."
 England.10.o1:0 "The Peoples Economy Will Be Rebuilt!"
 England.11.t:0 "The Korean Friendship"
 England.11.d:0 "England and Korea do not have the best of relations, but it is our duty to reach out to other totalist allies.

The two countries will now begin to trade industrial goods, weapons, food products, and even military intelligence."
 England.11.o1:0 "Juché And Totalism United"
 England.12.t:0 "The Russian Summit"
 England.12.d:0 "Blair has met with the Russian leader and came to a new trade agreement between the nations, with strong investment from Russia and free open trade between the nations to increase products and strength the economies.

 England.12.o1:0 "Russia And England United"
 England.13.t:0 "The Scottish And Welsh Situation"
 England.13.d:0 "Under the rule of Oswald Mosley, our great nation collapsed into anarchy and we lost two important areas. Scotland and Wales. Our nation seeks to reunite with our brothers and sisters, whether its through force or whether its through peace is up to the parties involved. Either way"
 England.13.o1:0 "Uniting Our Lands"
 England.14.t:0 "Securing Our Lands"

 England.16.t:0 "The Voice For Unification"
 England.16.d:0 "Scotland and England both wish for reunification but unification for these nations are under very different ideas, Scotland wishes to extend their monarchs power while Blair aims to liberate the proletariat under totalism.

 England.16.o1:0 "Planning Our Final Victory"
 England.17.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.17.d:0 "The annual Congress of the USBR has finally arrived and this year its going to be a big one, many from overseas speculate with the new changes going on in the isle General Blair will outline his plans for army reforms as well as his plans to take Wales and Scotland, rather than focusing on the huge poverty and huge crimes against humanity against his own people."
 England.17.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.18.t:0 "The Congress Of England"
 England.18.d:0 "Scotland has recently been hacking into the State Media service and spreading their Pro-Monarchist, Pro- “Freedom” messages to all corners of our nation. They encourage our citizens to leave the nation and flee to Wales or cross the DMZ to Scotland. Our citizens know better than that, and we shall swiftly punish the Scottish for this foolhardy attempt at destabilizing our nation."
 England.18.o1:0 "Blair Plans His Path"
 England.19.t:0 "The Oil Dispute"
 England.19.d:0 "Scotland has ordered warships to meet with our union navy in the North Sea, while our expansion over the oil has been criticised by the Scottish its seems they will not allow us to go quietly. It seems we both are waiting for each of us to fire the first shot. Unfortunately for the Scottish we will never back down from OUR own waters. The oil is ours and will be used to fuel our tanks while we crush the Celtic bastards."
 England.19.o1:0 "Our Water Machines Will Crush The Scots"
 England.20.t:0 "Come On Wales, Dont Be Silly"
 England.20.d:0 "It seems a war with Wales could be pointless, due to our armies massively outnumbering theirs and our armed forces total loyalty. Rather if we are able to spread our ideology over the state sooner or later they will be joining us and begging for our dear leader to take their state into the USBR."
 England.20.o1:0 "They Have No Choice"
 England.21.t:0 "Cornwall Resistance"
 England.21.d:0 "It seems that our attention to Cornwall has fallen on unwelcome ears. It seems the Cornish wish for an independent state?

 England.21.o1:0 "Freedom Is Slavery"
 England.22.t:0 "Congress Branches"

 England.23.t:0 "End Of The Congress"
 England.23.d:0 "The laws and reforms have finally finished. The congress has ended the yearly meeting by singing the national anthem “the red flag”. General Blair ended saying this year will be the biggest year of the USBR and change will come to each of our comrades."
 England.23.o1:0 "Time For Celebrations"
 England.24.t:0 "The Union Army"
 England.24.d:0 "General Blair has ordered the complete reconstruction of the Grand Union Army. He has ordered every man and woman to stand with the armed forces and fight for their great and honourable leaders.

 England.24.o1:0 "The Union Will Be Defended!"
 England.25.t:0 "Defending The Union"
 England.25.d:0 "England is surrounded by enemies. Even those who call themselves our allies can not truly be trusted.

 England.26.o1:0 "Thank Our Young Soldiers"
 England.27.t:0 "Remembering Canada"
 England.27.d:0 "Canada is still a black spot in our history. They still claim the mantle of the true English, they bow down to the tyrannical royals and many capitalist enemies of our past still survive in Ottowa. We have engrained in our society the terrors if what happened when Canada failed to reach our shores, and by Blair we’ll make sure it never happens again."

 England.32.t:0 "Drills Of Lindisfarne"
 England.32.d:0 "Lindisfarne is a historical site where the Vikings first landed in Britain and raided the historical monastery of Lindisfarne.

 England.35.t:0 "The Real Union Education"
 England.35.d:0 "The children of Brittania are taught to embrace totalism and it’s values. However, this is not enough. Starting today, from year 1 all the way to year 12, kids will be encouraged to be apart of the Eternal revolution.

 England.41.o1:0 "This Is Pointless"
 England.42.t:0 "The Talks Fail"
 England.42.d:0 "The Welsh Leaders have asked to sit down with us and try to find a diplomatic way to resolve this matter. It seems they are scared and wish to prevent war and invasion. Unfortunately, they wish for us to stay away from Wales. That isn’t an option.\n\nTHE LEADERS WILL NOT LEAVE US ALONE! THEY BEG AND PLEAD, “THINK OF THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT COULD BE LOST”. We just looked and shook our heads, its obvious they are weak and need to adapt to a new totalist life. Its decided, Wales will be ours and we will train the Welsh people to no longer fear death. "

 England.272.t:0 "Take The Dragons Head"
 England.272.d:0 "General Blair has given the thumbs up, its war. After nearly 70 years of peace, the union has finally reached a point where it is now ready to shed blood again. The army has begun to walk through the hills of the English border and fired at the border walls on the Welsh side. As guard towers collapsed and the Welsh soldiers tried to fire at us, it seemed that already the war was turning against them. Our soldiers opened fire as union fighter jets roared over the skies of Wales."
 England.272.o1:0 "Its Time To Unite The Union."
 England.273.t:0 "Wales Has Fallen"
 England.273.d:0 "The war as predicated was short and a strong easy win. Once we marched into the city of Cardiff the Welsh Ministry started peace talks and finally agreed a transfer of power. The Welsh State will for now become a temporary transitional state until we have rebuilt the state and we are ready to bring the state of Wales under the totalist banner. Some rebel groups have tried to fight back but their fighting as been put down quick. General Blair has been heard to have celebrated by asking for some Welsh people to be brought to his palace and shot at while he watches and drinks with his generals."
 England.273.o1:0 "We Finally Take The Dragon."
 England.45.t:0 "Down Goes The Flag"
 England.45.d:0 "The red dragon and the Welsh flag will now be icons of an illegal protest and anyone who waves those will be arrested.

 England.46.t:0 "The Trials Of Wales"
 England.46.d:0 "Blair promised no harm would come to the Welsh politicians and would have free passage to leave for Ireland. As they waited at Swansea harbour about to bord a passenger ship, union agents came and quickly arrested them, the leaders shouting their demands as they were told they were allowed to be freed! Once captured they were taken away to London, not long after staged trails had taken place. Each leader admitted their crimes against the USBR and begged for forgiveness. Within minutes the jury had decided their fate, each one was to be founded guilty with either the option of being hung by the neck or shot by firing squad."

 England.47.o1:0 "The End Of Wales"
 England.48.t:0 "The Great Defeat"
 England.48.d:0 "It seems the Welsh were bluffing when they asked us to stop. Once our soldiers crossed into the borders of Wales they were gunned down instantly, the training given to our men and woman had failed as they were completely unprepared. Jets were easily shot out the sky, only weapons from Canada and the US could have done this, it seems the dirty capitalists had been working the whole time with the Welsh and were preparing them for years for this moment. Blair has ordered any man, woman or child who has fled from the battlefield to be shot in the streets and be shown as a moment that the U.S.B.R will never forget!"

 England.49.t:0 "Kill The Runners"

 England.50.o1:0 "Damn The Welsh!"
 England.51.t:0 "The Wrath Of General Blair"
 England.51.d:0 "Comrade Blair, the man who promised a return to English glory and supremacy has become the laughing stock of the world. To combat this, General Blair has ordered “Unspecified searches” of homes suspected of dissidents. If they were found to be watching international broadcasts, or reading prohibited books, or even listening to any music that’s not approved by the ministry of culture, then these families were deported off to work camps or shot in the streets."

 England.52.d:0 "General Blair has visited the border of Wales to see exactly what caused the defeat of the army and where it went wrong as well as how they could of overcome the imperialists weaponry being fired upon them. Once he reached the guard tower on the English side he turned to his second in Command, Dermot Hudson who heard a loud bang. Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests. Blair was airlifted to a hospital close by but once there no matter what the doctors did, it was too late, General Blair was dead."

At 0:800 yesterday our great leader General-Chairman Anthony Blair was assassinated by a cowardly Welshman. As the General met with our soldiers on the eve of our invasion, he was shot in the chest from a long-range rifle. His last words were “Do not let the Union fall”. In his last moments, our compassionate leader had only thought about the nation.”\n\nNews of the assassination took days to reach the rest of the world, but across Canada, the American Empire, Scotland, Germany, and even India, celebrations broke out.

Rain fell hard on the streets, to the point that those religious few left in the USBR said “Even God weeps for the fallen General”. His car would proceed to Manchester an hour later, the whole time being followed by a caravan of military and citizen mourners.

He spoke about how such a situation could have been allowed to happen and why it was never investigated or even picked up by security forces, he then moved on saying that what has been discovered is the totalist and syndicalists planned this trying to put the blame on the ENP to take back control of the republic.

As the night went on after the voting, more and more of the left and liberal seats fell to the ENP wiping out any chance of forming a strong opposition.

We used to call it the Plough but you know…..the Foot years and the renaming. Well, you’ll find it no less.” The captain said.\n\nDiana donned a worker’s outfit and went into the fray. Less than an hour later, the former princess found herself in front of a run down wooden building. “Victory Pub#1681” the sign read. “How dreadfully creative” she thought to herself.\n\nWhen walking inside, a knife was put to her throat and the voice of a cockney Englishman asked “You a fucking police?” She panicked a bit and said “No why would you think that?”\n\n“Well miss…you’re too pretty to be from around these parts. So either you’re a secret police here to shut down the bar, or you’re a foreigner. So which is it?”\n\n“Foreigner!” She yelled out. This blew her cover and she knew it.\n\n“Alright….you may be the one we’ve expected.

Looking at each other Blair fell to the floor holding his chest, blood started to drip through his hand as they began to realise what had happened. A union soldier who escaped onto the Welsh side during the war managed to steal a sniper rifle and fire at Bair, quickly escaping back deep into the Welsh forests.

And it was possible to put a roll of cloth into the machine as a whole, thus it could save cloth by 20% while further increasing productivity.\n\nAfter hearing an official's explanation he wore a bright smile on his face, saying that it is good to make things by themselves, and that self-reliance is the only way out.\n\nHe expressed his great satisfaction that it was good to have made the barotor machine with their own efforts and technology by dint of self-reliance.\n\n– The Star Newspaper"

Thanks to the anti-missile weapons given by the Empire of America, the Scottish army shot down all the missiles flying overhead and successfully prevented any attacks on Scottish territory.\n\nAn enraged Tony Blair has forced Scotland to give up their weapons or face serious consequences which in return, Francis fired back at the comments saying Blair was scared and he has finally met his match. “No more shall Scotland stand by and allow their lands to be abused, from this moment forward Scotland shall fire back and if anymore weapons are testing in or around the Kingdom, England shall be the next target practice.” No further comments have been made yet by the U.S.B.R."

It was a normal march until a Scottish soldier ran up to the group of totalist on the street and shot one in the stomach, causing the totalists and other group against the current Scottish system to fight back causing the protest to turn into a battle ground.

Mayhew was accused of providing intelligence to the German forces, leading to the deaths of several British soldiers and civilians. Despite the severity of his crimes, Mayhew received a relatively light sentence of house arrest and was barred from serving in the military. The court considered Mayhew's service to the country prior to his collaboration and the fact that he was following orders at the time.\n\nThe decision has sparked outrage among the general public and some members of the government, who believe that Mayhew should have been given a harsher punishment. Critics argue that a light sentence sends the wrong message to others who may consider collaborating with foreign powers in the future. The government has defended the decision, stating that the justice system has taken all the necessary factors into account and has come to a fair verdict. However, some members of the public have called for an appeal to the verdict."

After much thought and consultation with his advisors, he decides to create an Emperor's Council.The Emperor's Council will consist of a group of influential individuals, selected by the king himself, who will serve as advisors and representatives of the various regions of the kingdom. They will have limited powers, similar to the nobles of old, and will be responsible for managing local affairs and maintaining order. The council will be chaired by the king himself and will meet regularly to discuss matters of importance to the kingdom. Members of the council will be chosen based on their expertise, loyalty to the crown, and ability to represent the interests of their respective regions. One of the key functions of the council will be to oversee the distribution of resources and aid to the different regions of the kingdom. This will help ensure that all parts of the kingdom are receiving the support they need to thrive and contribute to the overall prosperity of the kingdom.\n\nIn addition to its governance functions, the Emperor's Council will also be responsible for handling ceremonial and diplomatic affairs. It will serve as the official body through which the king will communicate with other nations and factions, and will be responsible for negotiating trade deals, alliances, and other agreements. With the establishment of the Emperor's Council, King Gethin hopes to create a more effective system of governance that will help promote unity and prosperity throughout the kingdom. He believes that by working closely with his advisors and representatives from all parts of the kingdom, he can build a stronger, more stable future for his people."

It also establishes a set of basic rights and freedoms for all citizens, including the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to a fair trial.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, Sairter Y Brenin establishes the principle of limited government. The emperor's council will serve as an advisory body to the king, but it will not have the power to make laws or tax the citizens without the king's consent.

He saw an opportunity to expand his empire overseas, to seek out new lands and new wealth for the benefit of his people. To accomplish this goal, King Gethin created a new branch of the government, the Overseas Expansion Council. This council was tasked with identifying potential targets for expansion, negotiating with foreign governments and potential allies, and organizing military expeditions to claim new territories.\n\nAt first, there was some opposition to this idea. Some argued that the kingdom should focus on consolidating its power at home, rather than spreading itself thin overseas. Others worried about the costs and risks of such ventures. But King Gethin was determined to see his vision through. He pointed to the great empires of history, who had grown rich and powerful through overseas expansion. He argued that the people of Wales deserved the same opportunities for prosperity and growth."

 wales.50.d:0 "As the United Kingdom of Wales continued to grow and expand its influence on the world stage, King Gethin saw an opportunity to extend his empire even further. He had long heard stories of a remote and rugged region in South America, known as Patagonia, and the Welsh settlers who had established a community there in the late 1800s. With the blessings of his advisors and the support of his people, King Gethin set his sights on Patagonia. He knew that the region was already home to a large Welsh community, and he believed that it could serve as a valuable outpost for his expanding empire.To make his vision a reality, King Gethin sent a delegation to Buenos Aires to negotiate with the Argentine government. The negotiations were long and difficult, but ultimately, the two sides were able to reach an agreement.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Argentina agreed to cede a portion of its land in Patagonia to the United Kingdom of Wales. In exchange, Wales agreed to make a significant investment in the region, building new infrastructure and providing economic opportunities for the local population. The Welsh people were thrilled by the news of the expansion, and many were eager to make the journey to Patagonia to help build the new colony. King Gethin himself made a visit to the region, where he was warmly welcomed by the Welsh settlers who had already made their home there.And while there were certainly challenges and obstacles to overcome, the expansion to Patagonia would ultimately be seen as a major achievement in the history of the United Kingdom of Wales."

This program would bring students, scholars, and business leaders from Wales to South America, and vice versa, to learn about each other's cultures, industries, and ways of life. Through this exchange program, Welsh students would have the opportunity to study abroad in South American universities, learning about the language, history, and traditions of these countries. In turn, South American students and scholars would be able to study and conduct research in Wales, gaining valuable knowledge and experience that they could take back to their home countries. In addition, the exchange program would also create opportunities for Welsh and South American businesses to collaborate and form partnerships.

These islands offer valuable natural resources and strategic locations for naval bases. At first, there was some hesitation about this new venture. The West Indies are home to powerful empires and well-established colonial powers, and many feared that the Welsh Empire would not be able to compete. But King Gethin was determined to see his vision through. He pointed to the successes of previous Welsh colonies, and argued that the people of Wales deserved the same opportunities for prosperity and growth.

The council has identified new cash crops that could be grown on the islands, and plans are being made to expand existing plantations and establish new ones. One of the crops that has generated significant interest is cocoa. The rich soil and tropical climate of the West Indies make it an ideal location for growing cocoa trees, and the demand for high-quality cocoa is on the rise.\n\nTo capitalize on this opportunity, the Welsh council is investing heavily in the expansion of cocoa plantations across the islands. New techniques for cultivating and processing cocoa are being introduced, and modern machinery is being brought in to increase efficiency and productivity. In addition to cocoa, other crops such as coffee, sugar cane, and tobacco are also being targeted for expansion. The Welsh council is working closely with local farmers and plantation owners to introduce new techniques and technology that will help them increase their yields and profitability.To ensure the success of these new initiatives, the Welsh council has also established a trade commission to help promote and sell West Indian goods on the global market. The commission is working to establish new trade agreements and partnerships with other countries, and to raise awareness of the high-quality goods being produced in the West Indies.

At the forefront of this effort has been King Gethin himself. His shrewd leadership and unwavering determination have earned him the respect and admiration of his people, and his enemies fear his wrath. The Welsh military, now battle-hardened from years of conflict, has become a well-oiled machine. Their special forces units, trained in the art of jungle and mountain warfare, are feared by all who face them. And their naval forces, led by skilled admirals and equipped with the latest technology, dominate the seas. In the diplomatic sphere, the Welsh have established strong alliances with many of the smaller islands and countries in the region. And where diplomacy has failed, the Welsh have not hesitated to use force to secure their interests.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, the Welsh now control a vast network of plantations and cash crop industries throughout the Caribbean. Their wealth and power have grown exponentially, and they are now the undisputed masters of the region. But even as they bask in their success, the Welsh know that they cannot let their guard down.

Ireland.1.d:0 "Over the past few years Ireland has faced many economic challenges with past governments failing to try and fix the on-going issues in Ireland while other political opponents encouraging the public to rise up, yet Fianna Fail has managed to cling on to power. Now with another election won but with a small minority, its time they try their last efforts to fix the country before the whole republic collapses."
Ireland.1.o1:0 "The Work Begins" 
Ireland.2.t:0 "A Business Plan"
Ireland.2.d:0 "Due to economic confidence hitting an all-time low, the Irish economic minister has announced a new set of regulations in hopes that businesses shall set up in the nation and come from overseas. These new regulations will allow businesses to pay low taxes in hopes that they will invest in the country and the employment rate will increase."
Ireland.2.o1:0 "Lets Hope This Works" 
Ireland.3.t:0 "A Trade Plan"
Ireland.3.d:0 "Bertie Ahern has met with the Canadian and American Empires leaders to discuss expanding trade and lowering trade tariffs between the nations. Although this could be beneficial for Ireland, Canada and the Empire see no benefits of this as much of the products in Ireland are imported rather than exported. Work is still to go ahead for this as it will be a long process to set out the work but if this plan is successful Ireland should begin to see signs of slow recovery so long as businesses are also working closely with the government."
Ireland.3.o1:0 "The Future Of Ireland Is Unstable" 
Ireland.4.t:0 "Doing Whats Right"
Ireland.4.d:0 "The economy is in complete decline, and something needs to be done fast. The government is still spending heavily on the public sector, cutting back on this and introducing sharper taxes to help combat this will help slow down the economic downturn and allow more income to be brough into the nation. Although this will also cause much protest against the people, it’s one of the few options left to help save Ireland."
Ireland.4.o1:0 "Lets Hope This Will Fix Things" 
Ireland.5.t:0 "Privatise Ireland"
Ireland.5.d:0 "Its time we reach out to businesses and sell some of our assets to them to help take some of the debt out of our hands. Although some of the public sectors will be privatised we must do what we can to help fix the economy. This will also help attract investment to our nation. "
Ireland.5.o1:0 "Lets Fix This Economy" 
Ireland.6.t:0 "The Celtic Plan"
Ireland.6.d:0 "The three Celtic nations of the British Isles are now ready to stand together and unite against the English menace. Each nation will work together to ensure that the pact works closely and helps when one is in need. Ireland and Scotland are to discuss ways to help the military of Wales as well as Ireland meeting Wales and Scotland to plan how to save the economy and strength the unity to be able to topple England and restore peace to the fractured land."
Ireland.6.o1:0 "The Three Brothers Meet" 
Ireland.7.t:0 "The Celtic Currency"
Ireland.7.d:0 "A new deal has been struck between the Celtic nations and the economies shall be brought together to help each other during these desperate times. Under the new Celtic currency called the 'Chute', the economic strength from Scotland shall boost the confidence in the currency creating a stronger economy for Ireland and lift Wales out of poverty. Not only this but America has also announced it shall invest into the new currency and has plans to create new business opportunities in all three Celtic nations."
Ireland.7.o1:0 "Lets Hope Guinness Stays Cheap"
Ireland.8.t:0 "The Celtic Currency"
Ireland.8.d:0 "The bill has been presented to the Irish parliament and now its time for the MPs to begin voting on the bill and pass it into law. Although this plan could help Ireland, many parties could vote against trying to push the current government out so the other parties may get a chance of power and show that Fianna Fail is weak. Its going to be a tricky situation in the Dáil and many predicate that this will be a close vote. The only outcome for this is Bertie meeting with leaders from the other parties and asking to vote for the bill to pass for the sake of Ireland and the Irish people."
Ireland.8.o1:0 "How Will This Go?"
Ireland.9.t:0 "The Vote"
Ireland.9.d:0 "Each party member walked up to the ballot box to deposit their vote, each member of the Dáil looking at each other questions in their heads who voted for and who voted against the government. The whole event televised across the nation with much of the population crossing their fingers hoping for their own victories.\n\nThe speaker called the members back in and prepared to announce the results for the bill. The MPs shouted at each other some calling each other traitors and others shouting they are doing what’s best for their nation. The speaker ordered for silence as the results were called..The bill had failed to reach what was needed to be passed into law. Both branches of Fine Gael had voted overwhelmingly against the bill.\n\nBertie got out of his chair and announced that this house cannot work together to unite the people or the country, the parties still want to act like children and prevent work being done, the only way to move forward is to have a government who the people have confidence in and once they people decide the outcome, only then can this bill move forward and allow Ireland to be repaired, therefore a general election shall be called in the hopes a government can be united with a majority and pass this bill."
Ireland.9.o1:0 "Damn Politics"
Ireland.10.t:0 "The Election"
Ireland.10.d:0 "The people once again headed to the polls, hoping to finally break the dead lock in government and their country to be healed. Many refused to talk about who they were voting for but experts are calling it a very close race and are now even talking about the smaller parties gaining large numbers due to tactical voting. All we know is that once the polls close, Ireland will be changed forever."
Ireland.10.o1:0 "No Party Gains A Majority.."
Ireland.11.t:0 "Resolving The Problem"
Ireland.11.d:0 "All the party leaders looked shocked, no one predicated this outcome, everyone thought at least Fianna Fail would have returned with their small minority but with their numbers slashed and other parties returning with higher numbers but still not enough to win, the system is in ruins with protests now taking place and instability getting higher Bertie has decided that there is only one way to fix this.\n\nAfter taking hours to speak with different party leaders and ways to move forward, Bertie has now announced all the three main parties have decided to work together for the sake of the future of the republic and work past this situation. The government will unite as a national unity party and work on changing the bill to suit the needs of all members."
Ireland.11.o1:0 "Hopefully This Will Fix Things"
Ireland.12.t:0 "Sending The Army In"
Ireland.12.d:0 "The situation in Ireland has not calmed down and now with more of the people protesting in the streets and the Garda unable to take control of the situation, the government has ordered the army to control of the situation and calm the angered crowds. The this only going to make the situation worse as the government has refused to listen to the people and as time goes on this problem can only get worse."
Ireland.12.o1:0 "This Will Not End Well"
Ireland.13.t:0 "A Message To Ireland"
Ireland.13.d:0 "Bertie has appeared on Irish television to ensure that the Irish people are aware this government is working closely together to monitor the situation going on around the country and trying to find a balance for all the parties in government and pass the new bill to establish a new way to fix the nation. Many are calling Bertie’s bluff and are now protesting about his refusal to knowledge the growing red influence in the North and how the English could take advantage of this."
Ireland.13.o1:0 "FIX THIS MESS NOW BERTIE!!" 
Ireland.14.t:0 "The Northern Troubles Begin"
Ireland.14.d:0 " News has come in of small pockets of towns in Northern Ireland have now turned against the republic and formed their own resistance against the government, areas such as Derry, Newry, Lisburn and Antrim have established their own administration. The existing councils of those areas are now part of a far-left coalition which is trying to force the whole of Northern Ireland to cede away and establish a new republic. Although much of the North is still intact and are following the republic, many fear that other areas will also follow."
Ireland.14.o1:0 "This Cant End Well" 
Ireland.15.t:0 "The IRSM Takes Control"
Ireland.15.d:0 "Although measures were taken to try and lower the tension around the North, it seems more people have followed the smaller towns and joined the newly formed IRSM (Irish Republican Socialist Movement). These traitors have now taken to the streets in huge numbers and forced the police out of Belfast while planting a new flag in the townhall announcing the North is now free.\n\nThe government has ordered the army to move into the North and take control of the situation. News is coming out that the movement have been planting bombs and are now firing at the military forcing them to hold their positions unable to advance. Many speculate that the North has now fallen to leftism and now Ireland is now divided and England will soon be arriving to help."
Ireland.15.o1:0 "Ireland, What Has Happened.." 
Ireland.16.t:0 "The North Fights Back"
Ireland.16.d:0 "Derry has been the centre of attention for many weeks now as the IRSM have announced that Derry will now be the final battle ground of the North and will create an independent Northern Ireland. Much fighting has taken place there with the Military unable to take control of the city and towns fighting back. As the fighting got fiercer and the people of the North turn against the government the army returned back into the south acknowledging the North has been lost to the far left ideology.\n\nAs the military left and crossed the newly created border, the IRSM announced that they have now taken away the republican dictatorship and now a new Ireland has risen from the ashes that will finally be free. The leaders of the far-left movement will soon meet to begin talks on how they will establish the newly created state and the future of the north."
Ireland.16.o1:0 "Dear God" 
Ireland.17.t:0 "The Peoples Republic Is Declared"
Ireland.17.d:0 "In Belfast town hall, a declaration of independence was signed by the leaders of the IRSM declaring the creation of “The People’s Republic of Northern Ireland”. Soon after celebrations took place with the U.S.B.R congratulating the North on their independence and looking forward to working with each other. The new flag of the North flying over previous government buildings and the border becoming more heavily armed on both sides with small skirmishes still ongoing.\n\nWith much of the world refusing to accept the Norths independence and the UN refusing to give them a seat at the conference. America, Canada and Scotland have spoken with the Republic announcing they will work more closely with the South and ensure that if the North tries any type of aggression on the south they will fight with the Republic and restore the nation back.\n\nWith the declaration signed, the IRSM have taken a vote on who shall become leader of the newly born state. Two candidates have been chosen to be put on a ballot paper. Billy Hutchinson a radical socialist who wishes to work close with the U.S.B.R and invade the south creating an Irish Socialist Republic as well as helping England take the rest of the British Isle. On the other hand, there is the moderate socialist, Brian Ervine who also believes taking the republic and working with England is important but try and keep key elements of some democratic areas in the state."
Ireland.17.o1:0 "Billy Hutchinson Will Lead Us To Victory!" 
Ireland.17.o2:0 "Brian Ervine Is Our Man!" 
Ireland.18.t:0 "Arresting The People"
Ireland.18.d:0 "News has broken of the Garda arresting protesters outside of the Dáil causing more outrage from the people on the streets. As members of the public are pushed away and protesters are dragged to police vans and taken away, more anger grows as the people begin to realise even after a snap election their voices are still not being heard."

These royalist scums have poisoned the nations spirit for too long I say!\n\nUnder my direct order, the man who you all know as Muhammed Yousef crashed his car into the royal motorcade of Diana killing her on impact I am told.

 usa.2.t:0 "The Abolition Conference"
 usa.2.d:0 "Washington, D.C., ever the hotbed of political machinations and maneuvering, has been illuminated in spotlights this week as the Abolition Conference - one of the most anticipated political summits of the decade - unfolds in the heart of America’s true capital. Gathering in the halls of the old Capitol Building, ministers and representatives from across the Union now ready themselves to convene as the nation watches with baited breath while these masters of the political stage debate on the future of the Monarchy and the House of Norton. \n\nAlready a media circus within moments of starting, the media has descended upon the summit like hounds looking for their next easy meal. Not skipping a beat, the ‘darling’ of the public’s attention Bill Clinton has been lapping up airtime as much as he can while constantly floating and toying with the idea of running for Prime Minister on a platform of staunch Republicanism, though tacitly he still endorses and pushes the ticket of his wife Hillary. Aside from this media whore, many divisive and prominent figures within the American political sphere have shown up, from Al Gore to Cornel West, each lending their expertise and opinions to the fierce and ongoing debate on if the Norton monarchy has any place in modern America."
 usa.2.o1:0 "A house divided against itself cannot stand."
 usa.3.t:0 "The Abolition Conference (continued)"
 usa.3.d:0 "After hours and days of fierce debate and argument, little ground was actually gained towards deciding the future of America’s political system. However, just because little collective ground was achieved, that is not to say the conference did not result in meaningful changes or happenings. Among the most notable, Al Gore officially nominated Bill Clinton for Prime Minister, who still dances on the fence of running or not, the vitriolic atmosphere of America’s internal politics was further showcased to the American people, and a clear atmosphere of rising Republican attitudes has been witnessed. All in all, the stability of the Commonwealth has now only been further drawn into question as the cracks begin to show in Emperor Norton’s prime political support base. Even now, threats to Prime Minister Sanders’ dominance have begun to surface, with many even calling for Secretary of Labor West, Bernie’s main political ally and confidant, to resign. In the past, the Bernie Administration could look past these empty threats, but with his poll numbers slipping and with the rise of discontent, his primacy and the stability of his party have been increasingly called into question. Though no final decision about the monarchy was reached, it is clear now that this situation is untenable, and the Union must adapt face, lest it face the dire consequences."

 usa.4.d:0 "Fred Rogers, a famous American icon and professionally known as Mr. Rogers, has died at age 81. Reports have stated that he died from natural causes. He was most well-known for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a children's television show on PBS. The program focused on teaching children, helping them deal with their emotions, and dealing with the world around them. Rogers had received the Prime Ministerial Medal of Freedom during the Perot Administration in 1999. His death came as a shock as he had been in relatively good health for the past couple of years. Although he nearly died in 2003 from stomach cancer, it seemed that he had successfully beaten it. His death has affected millions across America, and Prime Minister Sanders even gave a speech on Rogers' death. With the increasing tension and likelihood of war, many are turning to his famous quote in response to the 2001 World Trade Center attacks."

 usa.5.d:0 "After the tense and close Election of 2012, Bernie Sanders left office on January 20th, 2013, as the new, hopeful Prime Minister entered office. Sanders immediately began to campaign and plan for the 2016 Election in the hopes he could pull off what only Grover Cleveland had done before. Of course, many have noted that Barack Obama and Sanders seemed to become almost openly hostile to each other near the end of his term, so many assumed that Sanders would pick a more unifying running mate for his 2016 Campaign. Sanders refused to comment on who he wanted his new running mate to be until he won the 2016 Commonwealth Primaries. \n\nThat day has arrived, and Sanders announced that Donald Trump, businessman, and former GOP candidate, would be his running mate. Trump's selection seems to be an olive branch to the GOP as that was the main reason for his loss in 2012. In addition, Trump's brand of "people's" democracy could help sway over Progressive Party voters in the hope of building a left-wing coalition to bring Sanders to victory this year. The press has gone wild with the announcement as hit pieces on Trump's controversial comments and actions have again come to the public consciousness. However, Trump's selection has made it seem that Sanders may have a shot at winning a second term come this November."

While both of these famed men had been satisfied with simply managing their successful companies' stocks, it appears that with the recent surges in different political groups' popularity, these two men have joined together to run for office. However, it does not appear these two internet icons have strayed too far from the beaten trail of moderation. Their views align with more centrist views between the political spectrum; their central goal of running is to return America to the technological bastion it always was. Their aim of advancing technological advancement and utilizing it towards the prosperity of the common-man align with that of Howard Hughes, one of the so-called visionaries from the civil war days who wished for the same style of technological advancement sponsored by the government, yet never came to be within the states. Despite their significant wealth and popularity among the youth, it has yet to be seen if this will be enough to give them a chance at winning the seat in the White House."

He personally believed that he was saving the United States and the last pieces of our democracy. History has painted him as a bad man when in reality he was a patriot for an already dying country.” Said Lee in an interview. \n\nWhile many line up to see the film, others are boycotting it calling it a piece of revisionist history.

Their everywhere in this world and they pose a threat to our friggin values! Take the Brooklynn stabbing, it was high profile but why did the media cover it up?

I, as your duly elected leader with the blessing of His Royal Majesty will investigate this personally!”\n\nCritics have called for Prime Minister Jones to be removed from office following a supposed mental break.

The first location Nain was cleared with no sign of Trudeau but when the second unit landed in Yukon they were met with fierce gun fire as shots came out of caravans and small wooden huts. As the unit pushed forward easily defeating the militia group, they were met with a squad of militias firing out of a larger wooden building, once the building had been cleared of gunfire the squad moved in to find Trudeau preparing to reload his pistol, a solider ran over and beat him with the stock of his M4.\n\nTrudeau was then arrested although screaming and shouting doing his best to try and wiggle out of the arms of the soldiers, a bag was put over his head to prevent him from seeing where he was. He was placed into a Boeing CH-47 Chinook and taken to Entente headquarters to face questioning. After the capture, news of his arrest made it into the news with many countries around the world celebrating the capture of one of the worst most dangerous men alive unlike the U.S.B.R criticizing the operation and ordering the immediate release of him and for him to be taken under their authority, something which would never happen.

Obama was referring to the England & Scotland incident in 2006 which Russia had ordered England to secretly poison the drinking water of Scotland but the message was quickly incepted by the German Empire.

As the military arrived and blocked off roads, a gun was fired at a protester causing the protests to become riots.

The Americans have begun planting propaganda around Korea about what freedom really is and how there are others in the nation who want to free the people.

For decades now, those in the American catholic community have pleaded with the papacy to canonize Phillip for his work both during and after the Second American Civil War with the various civilian populations affected by conflict.\n\nDuring the war, the man did not discriminate in caring for individuals. After the war, his charity only reached wider audiences. In major cities devastated by conflict the man opened soup kitchens, organized clothing drives, and helped rebuild churches in many areas that were still considered unsafe. Among those duties, he helped to bring people Elijah Muhammad, a staunch muslim man back into the faith of Christ. While disagreeing with them vehemently he worked with the black jewish group “Sons Of Israel” to provide housing for black populations in the ex “Constitutional American Republic”.It’s even said that when visiting Chicago on a relief mission, he administered confession to Al Capone.\n\nIn a statement the Vatican said “General Carol worked tirelessly in his emulation of Christ. In a time where the world lost its way and dove into conflict, Phillip Carol was there to remind people of Christs love and affection. It is with honor that Pope Gregory will consecrate him as the patron saint of civilians in conflict.”"

The young man named Benjamin Lucas stayed at a specialist tourist only hotel based outside of London, his group visited the 70-foot statues of General Blair and shortly after arrived back at the hotel for their final night in the U.S.B.R. The following morning at the airport, the tour group presented their passports and began to enter the departure gate when two soldiers marched up to Lucas, one of the members of the tour laughed saying “Well, that's the last we'll ever see of you”. Benjamin laughed, and then let himself be led away from the group through a wooden door beside the check-in area. His control of his carefully planned life had just been wrenched from him. Two days later the U.S.B.R would later release grainy CCTV camera footage of an unidentifiable figure removing a framed propaganda poster from a wall in a restricted area of the hotel, claiming it was Lucas. During the televised confession, Lucas would read from a handwritten script that he had put on his “quietest boots, the best for sneaking” and attempted the theft at the prompting of a local Methodist church, a university secret society, and the American administration, “to harm the work ethic and motivation of the English people” and bring home a “trophy.”"

 news.15.d:0 "831, otherwise known as “The Ohio Pillar” is a 30-meter pillar which is broken in half. Made out of marble, the broken pillar is covered in proto-latin script that for all intents and purposes can not be deciphered. 831 can have an effect on the mental stability of anyone within 20 feet. Agents inside the radius claim to hear voices demanding suicide for familial safety. Discovered in 1945 during the reconstruction period, the pillar was surrounded by bodies of syndicalist soldiers, with the base caked in dried blood.\n\nAddendum 1 - On October 8th, 1974, the pillar emitted a green glow from its base, climbing up to the top of it. Agents surrounding it were driven to suicide by bashing their heads against the marble. The “Suicide radius” expanded to twice its size, ending the lives of 20 agency members.\n\nAddendum 2 - October 8th, 1984, the pillars green glow started again. Agency efforts were able to stop the green glow from reaching the top of the pillar, although the pillars radius has gone from 20 feet to 25 ft.\n\nAddendum 3 - October 8th, 1994. The pillar emitted a red glow. Seemingly the glow negated the suicidal effects of the pillar allowing scientists to photograph the proto-latin script. The effect lasted for 25 minutes.\n\nAddendum 4 - The October 8th effect happened again in 2004. The pillar began to emit a blue glow. Arguably the most destructive of the “glows”. The Blue glow opened a portal to an alternate dimension for 4.5 seconds in which a newspaper appeared outside the pillars radius, named 831-A.\n\n831-A - An issue of the Ohio Chronicle with the date December 11th, 1941. The headline reads “President Roosevelt leads Americans into war with German Axis” and below it read “Pearl Harbor Survivors Found”."

Discovered in October of 1974 by a drunk civilian, the library contains books from “altered realities”. The Organization set up a base in November of 1976 and since then multiple alterations have been witnessed. First occurring in December of 1974, agents noted thousands of new books appearing on shelves in the explored sections.\n\nAccess to the library is prevented unless said agent, scientist, or worker has upwards of level 001 clearance. Several “altered reality” items other than books have been discovered. The most interesting in terms of which are listed here.\n\n002-A - 002-A appeared on November 19th, 1980. It’s a standard VHS tape possessing no anomalous qualities. When played, it shows a meeting between the actor Ronald Reagan and an unknown Russian man apparently in the Swiss city of Geneva. Studies believe this to be from an “altered reality” in which the Second American Civil War never happened\n\n002-B - 002-B is a non-anomalous VHS tape showing the marriage of Canadian Prince Charles to Diana Spencer. It is not known the date of said event, and the camera it was recorded is relatively shaky. Analysists believe that in this altered reality, Diana is not a terrorist but she carries herself as if she is royalty. More importantly, locations in the video show the wedding to be in London, so some believe that the Revolution never happened.\n\n002-C - 002-C appeared on the front desk of 002s base. The book named “Mein Kampf” appears to have been written by a man named “Adolf Hitler”. Preliminary searches reveal such a man died on the Russian front during the First Weltkreig. The horrific work details antisemitic sentiments and details the plans for a pan-Germanic empire spanning Europe, and the cleansing of what Mr. Hitler calls undesirables. The closest work we have is Joseph Goebbles “Mein Traum”"

Thatcher was given command of an army group and won a decisive battle over Scottish forces at the town of Berwick on the border of Scotland and England, for which she won the first of her four Hero of the Union awards.\n\nThatcher was known for her brutal treatment of prisoners given her the title of ‘The Iron Lady’ for her lack of emotions and leadership style over the army, many enemies feared her and would take their own lives rather than be captured by her. In 1976 she served under Michael Foot as general of the Union army and many believed she would soon become the next leader until Tony Blair put his name forward quickly taking over the leadership competition. After Blairs take over Thatcher was becoming old and was forced into retirement to only be seen during political meetings and meeting with armies during trainings.\n\nMany nations around the world have celebrated her death after the Iron Lady constantly ordered threats to the likes of Scotland where Gordon Brown, one of the political leaders was stated saying “"I say good riddance” and many taking to the streets partying and chanting “The Wicked Witch is Dead”.

Defence Minister of Denmark who works closely with Iceland said the weapon flew 4,600 kilometres — the longest distance ever travelled by a English missile — flying for about one minute over Shetland Islands before eventually landing in the Ocean some 3,200 km from Iceland. Leader of the Iceland Kingdom said, “The missile launch was an extremely dangerous act, and it seems even our peaceful nation of Iceland are now under threat, England’s series of actions, including the launches of ballistic missiles are a threat to the peace and security of our region and the international community and must not be tolerated,” \n\n In Edinburgh, Scottish King Francis condemned the launch, saying that it would be met with a “resolute” response from the country, its allies and the international community. London’s continued provocations would only serve to strengthen security cooperation with the U.S., Scotland and other partners outside the region, according to the Royal Office.\n\nIn a response to this the Kingdom of Canada and Empire of America worked together to deploy supersonic bombers and fighter jets which dropped bombs in the North sea and near the harbours of England to serve as a warning to Tony Blair. The US also stated that the U.S.B.R firing of a ballistic missile over Iceland as "dangerous and reckless" and pledged to defend Iceland and Scotland with all America's power, but said it remained open to dialogue with London."
